Abstract
Aim

Smartphone use has become prevalent and rapidly expanding. Therefore, it is essential to determine the potential adverse effects. This study aims to assess the prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime and its association with sleep quality and educational-related activities among medical students.

Subject and methods

The current cross-sectional study included 1184 male and female undergraduate medical students at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect data on personal characteristics, smartphone use, and academic activities. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index ((PSQI) was used for the assessment of sleep quality.

Results

The result revealed that bedtime smartphone use was highly prevalent (96.5 %), with nearly half (46.9%) of studied medical students using them for more than 2 hours. Social media was at the top of the usage list (74.2%), followed by communication (48.8%). Smartphone users at bedtime had a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality, increased sleep latency, difficulty in maintaining sleep, and shorter sleep duration compared to non-user (p-value<0.05). The probability of poor sleep quality is significantly increased by bedtime smartphone use, regular coffee drinking, hostel residence, and proximity of the phone during sleep, whereas the likelihood of poor sleep quality is significantly decreased by physical activity. A significant association between poor sleep quality and academic performance was also reported.

Conclusion

This study emphasizes the negative impact of smartphone use at bedtime on sleep quality and quantity, which in turn has a negative effect on academic performance. Therefore, medical students are strongly encouraged to limit their smartphone use before bedtime for better sleep and academic performance.

Background

Smartphones have transformed global lifestyles and become an integral part of many people’s lives, particularly adolescents (Okela 2023), due to their connectivity and information access, which enable web browsing, entertainment, and communication for users. Moreover, smartphones are increasingly becoming an essential educational tool for all students (Hashmi et al. 2019). Egypt has 75.66 million cellular connections as of January 2022 (Kemp 2022), and 70% of internet users are university students (MCIT 2021).

However, the constant use of and addiction to cell phones can have negative physical, psychological, and social effects on individuals (Naveenta et al. 2016; Okasha et al. 2021). In Egypt, Eldesokey (2021) found that smartphone addiction was prevalent among medical students at a rate of 53.6%, and Mohamed and Moustafa (2021) reported a significantly higher rate of 74.7%.

As a key indicator of problematic issues, smartphone use before bedtime was prevalent among users (Paik et al. 2019). Increased use of smartphones before bedtime directly predisposes users to sleep disturbances and psychological distress (Alshobaili and AlYousefi 2019). Prolonged use of mobile phones at night has a significant impact on circadian rhythms. The light emitted from smartphone screens is rich in the blue portion of the visible light spectrum and has a potent stimulating effect on retinal ganglion cells containing melanopsin. Stimulation of these cells suppresses melatonin secretion and reduces sleep quality (Randjelović et al. 2019; Rathakrishnan et al. 2021).

Sleep is necessary for all mental, physical, and emotional daily activities. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs cognitive functions such as memory, concentration, and response time. Among medical students, good sleep quality is vital for academic development due to the nature of their study and the vast number of tasks they must complete ((Dewald et al. 2010; Al Shammari et al. 2020; Rathakrishnan et al. 2021). Poor sleepers experience more daytime difficulties as regards fatigue, sleepiness, poor cognition, and attention during class than those who sleep well (Alapin et al. 2000; Orzech et al. 2011).

The aforementioned associations can be explained by the stressor-strain-consequence (SSO) theory. This theory assumes that a stressor indirectly impacts the outcome, and the strain usually acts as an intermediary between the stressor and the outcome (Gary and Koeske 1993). Therefore, late-night use of smartphones (as a stressor) negatively affects academic performance (as an outcome) through the intervening strain effect of worse sleep quality and cognitive function depletion (Luqman et al. 2020).

Numerous studies demonstrate that the majority of mobile users suffer from sleep deprivation and increased stress, impairing their cognitive and learning abilities (Naveenta et al. 2016; Rupani et al. 2016; Bouazza et al. 2023). Until now, few studies have been conducted on medical students using smartphones before bedtime and their impact on sleep disturbances and academic performance. Hence, the current study aimed to assess the prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime and its association with sleep quality and related educational activities among undergraduate medical students in the Faculty of Medicine, Al-Azhar University, Cairo.

Subjects and methods

An observational cross-sectional study was performed from March 2021 to March 2022, including 1184 male and female undergraduate medical students from all academic grades of both faculties of medicine (boys and girls), Al-Azhar University at Cairo.

Sample size and sampling technique

The sample size was calculated according to the following formula (n=[(Zα/2)2* P(1- P)]/d2), assuming a proportion of medical students with poor sleep quality of 55% (Jahrami et al. 2020), a confidence level of 95%, and an absolute precision of 0.03. Accordingly, the minimum required sample size was 1056. Following the addition of 15% to account for attrition, the final sample size was 1184. The sample size was proportionately allocated to both faculties of boys and girls. The studied participants were selected based on a stratified cluster sampling technique; first, students were stratified according to academic grades, and then 1 or 2 classes (clusters) were chosen randomly from each academic grade. Except for subjects diagnosed with sleep disorders, chronic respiratory illnesses, and physical or mental illnesses that affected sleep, all students in the selected clusters were eligible to participate in the study.

Study tools

A Self-administered questionnaire consisting of 4 parts was used: The first section consisted of questions regarding demographic information (i.e., age, sex, academic year, living status, and body mass index) and lifestyle behaviors (i.e., consumption of caffeinated drinks after 4 p.m., smoking, and exercise for half an hour at least three times/week).

The 2nd part assessed smartphone use behaviors in which students were asked about the average time of smartphone use/day, smartphones use within two hours before bedtime, and the duration of their usage at bedtime (<1 h, 1–2 h, more than 2 h). In addition, they were asked about the most common reason for using their cellphones before bed, the adjustment of the screen’s brightness, whether they kept their smartphones under the pillow or by the bed during sleep, and whether they switched off their phones during sleep.

In the 3rd part, the PSQI was used to assess the quality of sleep (Buysse et al. 1989). It consists of 19 items divided into 7 components, including questions about sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, use of sleep medication, daytime dysfunction, and subjective sleep quality. Each component was scored from 0 to 3, with a total score between 0 to 21. Participants with a score above 5 were considered poor sleepers.

The 4th part evaluated education-related activities; students were asked whether they had difficulty waking up, morning fatigue, poor grades, difficulty concentrating, class absence, and tardiness.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23 (IBM Corp. Released 2015. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Quantitative variables were reported as mean± standard deviation. Nonparametric data were represented in median and interquartile ranges, while qualitative variables were summarized in frequencies and percentages and compared utilizing the chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify predictors for poor sleep quality among the studied students. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.

Ethical consideration

This study was approved by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Medicine for Girls, Al-Azhar University. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after clarification of the aim of the study and the confidentiality of the information.

Results

Students’ profiles are depicted in Table 1 and Fig. 1. A total of 1184 medical students (Boys and Girls) at the Faculty of Medicine, Al Azhar University in Cairo, were recruited in the study. The mean age was 21.4±1.6, ranging between 18 to 24 years; 55.5% were boys, with the majority living in a hostel. About half reported consuming caffeinated beverages frequently, while only one-third were physically active. The BMI indicated that 48.8% were overweight or obese.

The smartphone use pattern is depicted in Table 2 and Fig. 2. All participants owned smartphones, the mean hours of mobile usage was 4.7± 0.5 ranging from 2 to 8 hours, and 96.5 % of students using smartphones at bedtime, with nearly half (46.9%) used them for more than 2 hours. Social media usage was the highest among students (74.2%), followed by communication (48.8%), and academic search usage was the lowest (30.3%). The majority of students do not adjust the screen’s brightness or switch their phones off during sleep.

Table 3 and Fig. 3 depict the relationship between sleep patterns and smartphone use before bed. Approximately two-thirds (63.1%) of all participants had a PSQI score > 5 (they were considered poor sleepers), and 64.2% of bedtime smartphone users were poor sleepers. In addition, the median of PSQI was statistically significantly higher among bedtime smartphone users than among non-user students (7 versus 5, respectively) (p-value <0.05). By comparing phone bedtime users to non-users, it was found that about two-thirds (66.5%) faced difficulty falling asleep, 61% took more than thirty minutes, and 51.2% had interrupted sleep. In addition, 40.9% of them slept less than the recommended amount for their age (<7 h) and spent an average of 8.8±1.4 hours in bed, with statistically significant differences (p-value <0.05).

Discussion

Smartphones enable us to utilize various applications that make our lives more organized. However, it can be somewhat distracting, particularly for adolescents and young adults, negatively affecting cognition and development. The present study focused on the smartphone usage patterns of medical students to determine the impact of smartphone use at bedtime on sleep quality and, consequently, academic performance.

The current study showed that all participants own smartphones with 4.7± 0.5 hours as mean daily usage ranged from 2 to 8 hours. This finding is in agreement with Rafique et al. (2020), who found that smartphone ownership was 98% among Sauidian University students. In addition, Meng et al. (2021) in China revealed that all medical participant students (recruited from all relevant medical majors and all years of medical school) had smartphones with nearly the same duration of daily mobile usage in China (5 hours) and longer duration (8.57 hours) in Saudi Arabia. The bedtime usage of smartphones was highly prevalent (96.5 %) among the study participants. This finding is compatible with Pham et al. (2021), Alshobaili and AlYousefi (2019), and Haque et al. (2017), who reported (98.1%, 92.6%, and 96.75%, respectively) bedtime usage among university students.

Smartphone overuse was defined as using more than one hour at bedtime (Boonluksiri 2018). About two-thirds of the participants were smartphone-over users (in which 48.6% of usage duration was >two hours, and 23.6% ranged from 1 to 2 hours). This result aligns with Meng et al. (2021), who found that 59% of college students used phones for more than an hour at bedtime.

Smartphones have enabled students to communicate with their colleagues and lecturers to share academic knowledge. It also enabled them to engage in social discussions and dialogue on different ideas and topics. They are also used for entertainment through gaming and watching videos. In the present study, social media was the most prevalent usage purpose (74.2%), followed by communication (48.8%), then watching videos (33.6%), while academic activity was presented by only 30.3%. In accordance, Haque et al. (2017) revealed that the preferred purposes of smartphone usage were social media apps (99.53%), educational apps (83.26%), video apps (74.42%), and gaming apps (31.63%). In addition, Gladius et al. (2018) found that 100% of their students used mobiles as a mode of communication, followed by social media (66.5%) and only 31.5% for academic purposes. Moreover, Meng et al. (2021) mentioned that 91% of college students used mobile phones for entertainment and 61% to obtain information. After the dominance of online learning during the COVID pandemic, the traditional face-to-face learning method was reintroduced and resumed, which may account for the relatively low proportion of students who use smartphones for academic purposes.

Medical students are at higher risk of sleep disturbances and their consequences due to poor time management skills and high academic load (Copaja-Corzo et al. 2022). About two-thirds of students in the present study had poor sleep quality (63.1%). This finding was supported by a systematic review in which that poor sleep quality was reported among 65% of European medical students (Rao et al. 2020). Contradictory to the present study findings, Meng et al. (2021) and Tao et al. (2017) reported a lower prevalence (13% and 9.8%, respectively), which could be attributed to the variation in a medical and educational environment.

Many college students are unaware of the side effects of using smartphones at bedtime; they incorrectly imagine that these media might help them sleep, and their phone use becomes part of their sleep routine (Amra et al. 2017). The current study demonstrated that poor sleep quality was significantly higher among bedtime smartphone users (64.2%) than non-users (31.7%), and reported that smartphone users at bedtime had a significantly higher prevalence of increased sleep latency (time to fall asleep), difficulty in maintaining sleep (sleep disturbances) and lower sleep duration in comparison to non-users (p-value<0.05). These findings are in agreement with other studies; Exelmans and Van den Bulck (2016 ) revealed that respondents who brought their mobile phones into the bedroom had significantly longer sleep latency, poorer sleep efficiency, more sleep disturbance, and greater daytime dysfunction.

Yang et al. (2019) reported that there was a gradual decline in sleep quality and duration, as well as an increase in sleep onset latency, due to the long-term effects of using light-emitting electronic devices in bed in his study that was conducted on students from six universities.

Also, Amra et al. (2017) found that adolescents who used cell phones after 9 p.m. had higher levels of sleep latency and delayed wake-up time than non-users. This finding is consistent with the current study’s logistic regression model, which revealed that smartphone users before bedtime had a higher risk of poor sleep quality (OR= 3.6) than non-users. They were 1.39 times more likely to experience poor quality of sleep. In addition, Pham et al. (2021) demonstrated that the use of electronic devices within two hours of bedtime led to a reduction in sleep quality after controlling for confounding variables. In addition, Meng et al. 2021 found that the risk of poor sleep quality was 1.41–1.59 times greater for those who used their phones for more than 30 minutes before bed.

The previous result can be explained by many hypotheses; one of them suggested that the short-wavelength light (blue light) emitted by mobile phones inhibits melatonin production, thus stimulating cognitive functions and increasing brain alertness. Sleep displacement is another mechanism; with the convenience of smartphone use in bed, time passes without noticing and displaces sleep time (Alshobaili and AlYousefi 2019). A third proposed assumption suggested that emotional arousal, scanning for messages, text updates, seeing exciting something, or reading a negative notification can cause hyperexcitability and contribute to a hyperarousal state (Rafique et al. (2020). Therefore, the quality of sleep is significantly improved when the smartphone is turned off at bedtime.

Regarding demographic and lifestyle factors affecting sleep quality, the current study revealed that hostel-dwelling students had poorer sleep quality than others. Multiple factors, including peer pressure, additional stress, and homesickness, may account for the poorer sleeping habits of hostel residents. In accordance, Saat et al. (2020) discovered that the residential neighborhood is a risk factor for poor sleep quality.

Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance for restoring wakefulness, modulating brain activity, and enhancing task performance (Khan et al., 2016). According to this study, frequent consumption of caffeinated beverages was associated with poor sleep quality. In agreement with this finding, Pham et al. (2021) and Al Shammari et al. (2020) suggested that consuming fewer caffeinated beverages earlier in the day is a more effective way to enhance sleep quality.

Moreover, this study demonstrated that those who did not exercise regularly had a higher rate of poor sleep quality than those who did this finding is consistent with Ozcan and Acimis (2021), who found that physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for poor sleep quality, aligning with Pham et al. (2021). Similarly, a systematic review done by Wang and Boros (2019) concluded that moderate exercise had a more favorable outcome on sleep quality than vigorous exercise through improved neuropsychological performance.

With regard to BMI, the current study found that poor sleep quality was significantly more prevalent among overweight and obese students than among normal-weight and underweight students. This result is consistent with the findings of Kristicevic et al. (2018), who demonstrated that poor sleep quality was more prevalent in cases with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 than in cases with BMI<25 kg/m2. This result can be attributed to the alterations in metabolism and/or sleep-wake cycles caused by obesity, which deteriorates sleep quality.

In contrast, in the current work it has been found that age, academic year, and smoking had no significant relationship with sleep quality. Abdallah et al. (2021) reported the same findings regarding age and smoking among Egyptian participants (also, no significant association between smoking and academic year with sleep quality were reported by Pham et al. 2021)).

The present work revealed insignificant differences between adjusting and not adjusting screen light mode on sleep quality, consistent with Pham et al. (2021). However, avoiding blue light exposure at bedtime is recommended through blocking glasses or filters to reduce sleep disturbances and improve sleep quality (Perez Algorta et al. 2018).

Good sleep is associated with good physical health, which is crucial for good academic performance. Poor sleep quality caused by excessive use of smartphones may influence students’ concentration levels, decision-creating, memory and learning abilities, which may result in low grades. (Amra et al. 2017; Wagner et al. 2004; Maheshwari and Shaukat 2019).

With respect to the effect of sleep quality on academic activities, this study revealed that most poor sleeper students faced difficulty in waking up, had morning fatigue, suffered from a decrease in concentration, and reported a decline in exam grades. At the same time, about two-thirds of them attended classes late and missed their classes, with statistically significant differences compared to students demonstrating good sleep quality.

In line, Gladius et al. (2018) found a significant association between poor sleep quality with mobile phone usage and academic performance (p<0.01). Similarly, Rathakrishnan et al. (2021) showed a negative relation between sleep quality and academic performance among Malaysian students. Furthermore, Elbilgahy et al. (2021) found a significant association between sleep disorders and academic performance among Egyptian and Saudi students related to internet addiction.

Strengths and limitations

The current study has many strengths, a large sample size that includes students from both male and female medical schools and all academic levels. In addition, the participants were selected at random, allowing the findings to be generalized to the remaining students. In addition, the prevalence of smartphone use before bed and poor sleep quality were demonstrated by our research. We further investigated the relationship between smartphone use before bed, sleep quality, and educational activities. Nevertheless, certain limitations should be reported. First, due to the cross-sectional design, it was not possible to examine casual associations between smartphone use before bed, poor sleep quality, and academic disruption. Second, sleep quality and duration of smartphone use were self-reported by participants, which may have led to recording bias.

Conclusion

This study revealed that smartphone use at bedtime was highly prevalent among the medical students surveyed. In addition, poor sleep quality was prevalent among study participants, and it was significantly higher among bedtime smartphone users than among non-users, making this a significant health issue that negatively impacts academic activities. Therefore, it is crucial to educate medical students about the negative effects of smartphone use before bedtime on sleep and the importance of adequate sleep for good academic performance.

Therefore, it is essential to determine the potential adverse effects. This study aims to assess the prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime and its association with sleep quality and educational-related activities among medical students.\n\nSubject and methods\n\nThe current cross-sectional study included 1184 male and female undergraduate medical students at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect data on personal characteristics, smartphone use, and academic activities. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index ((PSQI) was used for the assessment of sleep quality.\n\nResults\n\nThe result revealed that bedtime smartphone use was highly prevalent (96.5 %), with nearly half (46.9%) of studied medical students using them for more than 2 hours. Social media was at the top of the usage list (74.2%), followed by communication (48.8%). Smartphone users at bedtime had a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality, increased sleep latency, difficulty in maintaining sleep, and shorter sleep duration compared to non-user (p-value<0.05). The probability of poor sleep quality is significantly increased by bedtime smartphone use, regular coffee drinking, hostel residence, and proximity of the phone during sleep, whereas the likelihood of poor sleep quality is significantly decreased by physical activity. A significant association between poor sleep quality and academic performance was also reported.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study emphasizes the negative impact of smartphone use at bedtime on sleep quality and quantity, which in turn has a negative effect on academic performance. Therefore, medical students are strongly encouraged to limit their smartphone use before bedtime for better sleep and academic performance.\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nPrevalence of sleep disturbances and its relationship with mobile phone overuse among an Iranian sample of students: a necessity for attention\nArticle Open access\n20 October 2023\nAssociation between the pattern of mobile phone use and sleep quality in Northeast China college students\nArticle 02 February 2021\nAssociation of sleep quality, smartphone addiction, and depressive symptoms among undergraduate medical students in Nepal\nArticle Open access\n02 October 2024\nExplore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\nCircadian Rhythms and Sleep\nNon-REM sleep\nREM sleep\nSleep Deprivation\nSleep Disorders\nWakefulness\nBackground\n\nSmartphones have transformed global lifestyles and become an integral part of many people’s lives, particularly adolescents (Okela 2023), due to their connectivity and information access, which enable web browsing, entertainment, and communication for users. Moreover, smartphones are increasingly becoming an essential educational tool for all students (Hashmi et al. 2019). Egypt has 75.66 million cellular connections as of January 2022 (Kemp 2022), and 70% of internet users are university students (MCIT 2021).\n\nHowever, the constant use of and addiction to cell phones can have negative physical, psychological, and social effects on individuals (Naveenta et al. 2016; Okasha et al. 2021). In Egypt, Eldesokey (2021) found that smartphone addiction was prevalent among medical students at a rate of 53.6%, and Mohamed and Moustafa (2021) reported a significantly higher rate of 74.7%.\n\nAs a key indicator of problematic issues, smartphone use before bedtime was prevalent among users (Paik et al. 2019). Increased use of smartphones before bedtime directly predisposes users to sleep disturbances and psychological distress (Alshobaili and AlYousefi 2019). Prolonged use of mobile phones at night has a significant impact on circadian rhythms. The light emitted from smartphone screens is rich in the blue portion of the visible light spectrum and has a potent stimulating effect on retinal ganglion cells containing melanopsin. Stimulation of these cells suppresses melatonin secretion and reduces sleep quality (Randjelović et al. 2019; Rathakrishnan et al. 2021).\n\nSleep is necessary for all mental, physical, and emotional daily activities. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs cognitive functions such as memory, concentration, and response time. Among medical students, good sleep quality is vital for academic development due to the nature of their study and the vast number of tasks they must complete ((Dewald et al. 2010; Al Shammari et al. 2020; Rathakrishnan et al. 2021). Poor sleepers experience more daytime difficulties as regards fatigue, sleepiness, poor cognition, and attention during class than those who sleep well (Alapin et al. 2000; Orzech et al. 2011).\n\nThe aforementioned associations can be explained by the stressor-strain-consequence (SSO) theory. This theory assumes that a stressor indirectly impacts the outcome, and the strain usually acts as an intermediary between the stressor and the outcome (Gary and Koeske 1993). Therefore, late-night use of smartphones (as a stressor) negatively affects academic performance (as an outcome) through the intervening strain effect of worse sleep quality and cognitive function depletion (Luqman et al. 2020).\n\nNumerous studies demonstrate that the majority of mobile users suffer from sleep deprivation and increased stress, impairing their cognitive and learning abilities (Naveenta et al. 2016; Rupani et al. 2016; Bouazza et al. 2023). Until now, few studies have been conducted on medical students using smartphones before bedtime and their impact on sleep disturbances and academic performance. Hence, the current study aimed to assess the prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime and its association with sleep quality and related educational activities among undergraduate medical students in the Faculty of Medicine, Al-Azhar University, Cairo.\n\nSubjects and methods\n\nAn observational cross-sectional study was performed from March 2021 to March 2022, including 1184 male and female undergraduate medical students from all academic grades of both faculties of medicine (boys and girls), Al-Azhar University at Cairo.\n\nSample size and sampling technique\n\nThe sample size was calculated according to the following formula (n=[(Zα/2)2* P(1- P)]/d2), assuming a proportion of medical students with poor sleep quality of 55% (Jahrami et al. 2020), a confidence level of 95%, and an absolute precision of 0.03. Accordingly, the minimum required sample size was 1056. Following the addition of 15% to account for attrition, the final sample size was 1184. The sample size was proportionately allocated to both faculties of boys and girls. The studied participants were selected based on a stratified cluster sampling technique; first, students were stratified according to academic grades, and then 1 or 2 classes (clusters) were chosen randomly from each academic grade. Except for subjects diagnosed with sleep disorders, chronic respiratory illnesses, and physical or mental illnesses that affected sleep, all students in the selected clusters were eligible to participate in the study.\n\nStudy tools\n\nA Self-administered questionnaire consisting of 4 parts was used: The first section consisted of questions regarding demographic information (i.e., age, sex, academic year, living status, and body mass index) and lifestyle behaviors (i.e., consumption of caffeinated drinks after 4 p.m., smoking, and exercise for half an hour at least three times/week).\n\nThe 2nd part assessed smartphone use behaviors in which students were asked about the average time of smartphone use/day, smartphones use within two hours before bedtime, and the duration of their usage at bedtime (<1 h, 1–2 h, more than 2 h). In addition, they were asked about the most common reason for using their cellphones before bed, the adjustment of the screen’s brightness, whether they kept their smartphones under the pillow or by the bed during sleep, and whether they switched off their phones during sleep.\n\nIn the 3rd part, the PSQI was used to assess the quality of sleep (Buysse et al. 1989). It consists of 19 items divided into 7 components, including questions about sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, use of sleep medication, daytime dysfunction, and subjective sleep quality. Each component was scored from 0 to 3, with a total score between 0 to 21. Participants with a score above 5 were considered poor sleepers.\n\nThe 4th part evaluated education-related activities; students were asked whether they had difficulty waking up, morning fatigue, poor grades, difficulty concentrating, class absence, and tardiness.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23 (IBM Corp. Released 2015. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Quantitative variables were reported as mean± standard deviation. Nonparametric data were represented in median and interquartile ranges, while qualitative variables were summarized in frequencies and percentages and compared utilizing the chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify predictors for poor sleep quality among the studied students. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.\n\nEthical consideration\n\nThis study was approved by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Medicine for Girls, Al-Azhar University. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after clarification of the aim of the study and the confidentiality of the information.\n\nResults\n\nStudents’ profiles are depicted in Table 1 and Fig. 1. A total of 1184 medical students (Boys and Girls) at the Faculty of Medicine, Al Azhar University in Cairo, were recruited in the study. The mean age was 21.4±1.6, ranging between 18 to 24 years; 55.5% were boys, with the majority living in a hostel. About half reported consuming caffeinated beverages frequently, while only one-third were physically active. The BMI indicated that 48.8% were overweight or obese.\n\nTable 1 General profile of the studied students\nFull size table\nFig. 1\n\nAlgorithm for the distribution of the studied students\n\nFull size image\n\nThe smartphone use pattern is depicted in Table 2 and Fig. 2. All participants owned smartphones, the mean hours of mobile usage was 4.7± 0.5 ranging from 2 to 8 hours, and 96.5 % of students using smartphones at bedtime, with nearly half (46.9%) used them for more than 2 hours. Social media usage was the highest among students (74.2%), followed by communication (48.8%), and academic search usage was the lowest (30.3%). The majority of students do not adjust the screen’s brightness or switch their phones off during sleep.\n\nTable 2 Pattern of phone use among smartphone bedtime-user students\nFull size table\nFig. 2\n\nPrevalence of smartphone use at bedtime among the studies students\n\nFull size image\n\nTable 3 and Fig. 3 depict the relationship between sleep patterns and smartphone use before bed. Approximately two-thirds (63.1%) of all participants had a PSQI score > 5 (they were considered poor sleepers), and 64.2% of bedtime smartphone users were poor sleepers. In addition, the median of PSQI was statistically significantly higher among bedtime smartphone users than among non-user students (7 versus 5, respectively) (p-value <0.05). By comparing phone bedtime users to non-users, it was found that about two-thirds (66.5%) faced difficulty falling asleep, 61% took more than thirty minutes, and 51.2% had interrupted sleep. In addition, 40.9% of them slept less than the recommended amount for their age (<7 h) and spent an average of 8.8±1.4 hours in bed, with statistically significant differences (p-value <0.05).\n\nTable 3 Sleep pattern in relation to smartphone usage at bedtime among the studied students\nFull size table\nFig. 3\n\nSleep quality in relation to bedtime smartphone use among the studied students\n\nFull size image\n\nRegarding factors and predictors that were related to sleep quality, poor sleep was prevalent among male students (53.0%), those living in hostels (88.1%), those with a sedentary lifestyle (77.1%), students who regularly consumed caffeinated drinks after 4 p.m. (57.7%), overweight and obese students (52.7%), and students who did not turn off their phones during sleep (82.9%), with statistically significant differences compared to those who scored good sleep quality (p-value <0.05), as shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4 Demographic and personal characteristics of studied students in relation to sleep quality score\nFull size table\n\nTable 5 displays the results of a logistic regression analysis indicating that the likelihood of poor sleep quality was increased by the following significant predictors: bedtime smartphone use (OR=3.569), regular coffee consumption (OR=1.888), hostel residence (OR=1.1615), and phone proximity during sleep (OR=1.283). In contrast, physical activity was found to significantly reduce the likelihood of poor sleep quality (OR) by 0.605.\n\nTable 5 Logistic regression of predictors of poor sleep quality among the studied students\nFull size table\n\nSleep quality and academic activities are described in Table 6. Poor sleepers reported greater deterioration in academic achievement compared to good sleepers, as (82.7%) of poor sleepers faced difficulty in waking up, (79.3%) had morning fatigue, (65.3) attended classes late, (67.4) missed their classes, (82.0%) suffered from a decrease in concentration, and (79.7%) reported a decline in exam grades, with statistically significant differences (p-value <0.05).\n\nTable 6 Academic performance in relation to sleep quality among bedtime smartphone users\nFull size table\nDiscussion\n\nSmartphones enable us to utilize various applications that make our lives more organized. However, it can be somewhat distracting, particularly for adolescents and young adults, negatively affecting cognition and development. The present study focused on the smartphone usage patterns of medical students to determine the impact of smartphone use at bedtime on sleep quality and, consequently, academic performance.\n\nThe current study showed that all participants own smartphones with 4.7± 0.5 hours as mean daily usage ranged from 2 to 8 hours. This finding is in agreement with Rafique et al. (2020), who found that smartphone ownership was 98% among Sauidian University students. In addition, Meng et al. (2021) in China revealed that all medical participant students (recruited from all relevant medical majors and all years of medical school) had smartphones with nearly the same duration of daily mobile usage in China (5 hours) and longer duration (8.57 hours) in Saudi Arabia. The bedtime usage of smartphones was highly prevalent (96.5 %) among the study participants. This finding is compatible with Pham et al. (2021), Alshobaili and AlYousefi (2019), and Haque et al. (2017), who reported (98.1%, 92.6%, and 96.75%, respectively) bedtime usage among university students.\n\nSmartphone overuse was defined as using more than one hour at bedtime (Boonluksiri 2018). About two-thirds of the participants were smartphone-over users (in which 48.6% of usage duration was >two hours, and 23.6% ranged from 1 to 2 hours). This result aligns with Meng et al. (2021), who found that 59% of college students used phones for more than an hour at bedtime.\n\nSmartphones have enabled students to communicate with their colleagues and lecturers to share academic knowledge. It also enabled them to engage in social discussions and dialogue on different ideas and topics. They are also used for entertainment through gaming and watching videos. In the present study, social media was the most prevalent usage purpose (74.2%), followed by communication (48.8%), then watching videos (33.6%), while academic activity was presented by only 30.3%. In accordance, Haque et al. (2017) revealed that the preferred purposes of smartphone usage were social media apps (99.53%), educational apps (83.26%), video apps (74.42%), and gaming apps (31.63%). In addition, Gladius et al. (2018) found that 100% of their students used mobiles as a mode of communication, followed by social media (66.5%) and only 31.5% for academic purposes. Moreover, Meng et al. (2021) mentioned that 91% of college students used mobile phones for entertainment and 61% to obtain information. After the dominance of online learning during the COVID pandemic, the traditional face-to-face learning method was reintroduced and resumed, which may account for the relatively low proportion of students who use smartphones for academic purposes.\n\nMedical students are at higher risk of sleep disturbances and their consequences due to poor time management skills and high academic load (Copaja-Corzo et al. 2022). About two-thirds of students in the present study had poor sleep quality (63.1%). This finding was supported by a systematic review in which that poor sleep quality was reported among 65% of European medical students (Rao et al. 2020). Contradictory to the present study findings, Meng et al. (2021) and Tao et al. (2017) reported a lower prevalence (13% and 9.8%, respectively), which could be attributed to the variation in a medical and educational environment.\n\nMany college students are unaware of the side effects of using smartphones at bedtime; they incorrectly imagine that these media might help them sleep, and their phone use becomes part of their sleep routine (Amra et al. 2017). The current study demonstrated that poor sleep quality was significantly higher among bedtime smartphone users (64.2%) than non-users (31.7%), and reported that smartphone users at bedtime had a significantly higher prevalence of increased sleep latency (time to fall asleep), difficulty in maintaining sleep (sleep disturbances) and lower sleep duration in comparison to non-users (p-value<0.05). These findings are in agreement with other studies; Exelmans and Van den Bulck (2016 ) revealed that respondents who brought their mobile phones into the bedroom had significantly longer sleep latency, poorer sleep efficiency, more sleep disturbance, and greater daytime dysfunction.\n\nYang et al. (2019) reported that there was a gradual decline in sleep quality and duration, as well as an increase in sleep onset latency, due to the long-term effects of using light-emitting electronic devices in bed in his study that was conducted on students from six universities.\n\nAlso, Amra et al. (2017) found that adolescents who used cell phones after 9 p.m. had higher levels of sleep latency and delayed wake-up time than non-users. This finding is consistent with the current study’s logistic regression model, which revealed that smartphone users before bedtime had a higher risk of poor sleep quality (OR= 3.6) than non-users. They were 1.39 times more likely to experience poor quality of sleep. In addition, Pham et al. (2021) demonstrated that the use of electronic devices within two hours of bedtime led to a reduction in sleep quality after controlling for confounding variables. In addition, Meng et al. 2021 found that the risk of poor sleep quality was 1.41–1.59 times greater for those who used their phones for more than 30 minutes before bed.\n\nThe previous result can be explained by many hypotheses; one of them suggested that the short-wavelength light (blue light) emitted by mobile phones inhibits melatonin production, thus stimulating cognitive functions and increasing brain alertness. Sleep displacement is another mechanism; with the convenience of smartphone use in bed, time passes without noticing and displaces sleep time (Alshobaili and AlYousefi 2019). A third proposed assumption suggested that emotional arousal, scanning for messages, text updates, seeing exciting something, or reading a negative notification can cause hyperexcitability and contribute to a hyperarousal state (Rafique et al. (2020). Therefore, the quality of sleep is significantly improved when the smartphone is turned off at bedtime.\n\nRegarding demographic and lifestyle factors affecting sleep quality, the current study revealed that hostel-dwelling students had poorer sleep quality than others. Multiple factors, including peer pressure, additional stress, and homesickness, may account for the poorer sleeping habits of hostel residents. In accordance, Saat et al. (2020) discovered that the residential neighborhood is a risk factor for poor sleep quality.\n\nCaffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance for restoring wakefulness, modulating brain activity, and enhancing task performance (Khan et al., 2016). According to this study, frequent consumption of caffeinated beverages was associated with poor sleep quality. In agreement with this finding, Pham et al. (2021) and Al Shammari et al. (2020) suggested that consuming fewer caffeinated beverages earlier in the day is a more effective way to enhance sleep quality.\n\nMoreover, this study demonstrated that those who did not exercise regularly had a higher rate of poor sleep quality than those who did this finding is consistent with Ozcan and Acimis (2021), who found that physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for poor sleep quality, aligning with Pham et al. (2021). Similarly, a systematic review done by Wang and Boros (2019) concluded that moderate exercise had a more favorable outcome on sleep quality than vigorous exercise through improved neuropsychological performance.\n\nWith regard to BMI, the current study found that poor sleep quality was significantly more prevalent among overweight and obese students than among normal-weight and underweight students. This result is consistent with the findings of Kristicevic et al. (2018), who demonstrated that poor sleep quality was more prevalent in cases with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 than in cases with BMI<25 kg/m2. This result can be attributed to the alterations in metabolism and/or sleep-wake cycles caused by obesity, which deteriorates sleep quality.\n\nIn contrast, in the current work it has been found that age, academic year, and smoking had no significant relationship with sleep quality. Abdallah et al. (2021) reported the same findings regarding age and smoking among Egyptian participants (also, no significant association between smoking and academic year with sleep quality were reported by Pham et al. 2021)).\n\nThe present work revealed insignificant differences between adjusting and not adjusting screen light mode on sleep quality, consistent with Pham et al. (2021). However, avoiding blue light exposure at bedtime is recommended through blocking glasses or filters to reduce sleep disturbances and improve sleep quality (Perez Algorta et al. 2018).\n\nGood sleep is associated with good physical health, which is crucial for good academic performance. Poor sleep quality caused by excessive use of smartphones may influence students’ concentration levels, decision-creating, memory and learning abilities, which may result in low grades. (Amra et al. 2017; Wagner et al. 2004; Maheshwari and Shaukat 2019).\n\nWith respect to the effect of sleep quality on academic activities, this study revealed that most poor sleeper students faced difficulty in waking up, had morning fatigue, suffered from a decrease in concentration, and reported a decline in exam grades. At the same time, about two-thirds of them attended classes late and missed their classes, with statistically significant differences compared to students demonstrating good sleep quality.\n\nIn line, Gladius et al. (2018) found a significant association between poor sleep quality with mobile phone usage and academic performance (p<0.01). Similarly, Rathakrishnan et al. (2021) showed a negative relation between sleep quality and academic performance among Malaysian students. Furthermore, Elbilgahy et al. (2021) found a significant association between sleep disorders and academic performance among Egyptian and Saudi students related to internet addiction.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThe current study has many strengths, a large sample size that includes students from both male and female medical schools and all academic levels. In addition, the participants were selected at random, allowing the findings to be generalized to the remaining students. In addition, the prevalence of smartphone use before bed and poor sleep quality were demonstrated by our research. We further investigated the relationship between smartphone use before bed, sleep quality, and educational activities. Nevertheless, certain limitations should be reported. First, due to the cross-sectional design, it was not possible to examine casual associations between smartphone use before bed, poor sleep quality, and academic disruption. Second, sleep quality and duration of smartphone use were self-reported by participants, which may have led to recording bias.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study revealed that smartphone use at bedtime was highly prevalent among the medical students surveyed. In addition, poor sleep quality was prevalent among study participants, and it was significantly higher among bedtime smartphone users than among non-users, making this a significant health issue that negatively impacts academic activities. Therefore, it is crucial to educate medical students about the negative effects of smartphone use before bedtime on sleep and the importance of adequate sleep for good academic performance.\n\nData availability\n\nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\nCode availability (software application or custom code)\n\nNot applicable\' for that section.\n\nReferences\n\nAbdallah AA, Mahfouz EM, Mohammed ES, Emam SA, Abd-El Rahman TA (2021) Sleep quality and its association with body weight among adults: an epidemiological study.

Abstract

The present cross-sectional study examined the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality in a sample of undergraduate students. Three hundred eighty-five undergraduate students completed a self-administered questionnaire containing sociodemographic variables, bedtime mobile phone use, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (attention and verbal memory). At bivariate level, increased scores in bedtime mobile phone use were significantly correlated with decreased scores in academic performance and sleep quality. Our multivariate findings show that increased scores in bedtime mobile phone use uniquely predicted decreased scores in academic performance and sleep quality, while controlling for gender, age, and ethnicity. Further untangling the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to academic performance and sleep quality may prove complex. Future studies with longitudinal data are needed to examine the bidirectional effect that bedtime mobile phone use may have on academic performance and sleep quality.

Keywords: bedtime mobile phone use, sleep quality, academic performance, cognitive functioning, young adults

1. Introduction

In recent years, the use of mobile phones has proliferated and brought with it a great influence on human communication through its rapid advancement [1,2]. Mobile phones are well received by users for two reasons: (a) multifunctionality: mobile phones are equipped with features such as an alarm clock, music player, games, internet, short message service (SMS), and video call, and (b) availability: mobile phones have become ubiquitous, enabling individuals to connect instantly and to engage in real-time communication at any time [3,4,5]. For these reasons, mobile phone is said to have the highest percentage of availability in the bedroom at night compared to other technological devices [6].

1.1. Mobile Phone Use in Young Adults

Mobile phones have attracted users of all ages. However, mobile phones are known to be vastly popular among young adults. A survey by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission [7] revealed that mobile phone use is dominated by young adults compared to teenagers, older adults, and senior citizens. To this end, mobile phones are particularly well received by university students for two reasons. First, mobile phones have become vital among university students as they accommodate their need of information-seeking and provide educational assistance. Second, mobile phone applications provide university students with access to instant communication and social media (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram) at any point of the day [8].

1.2. Bedtime Mobile Phone Use

Bedtime mobile phone use is defined as constant use of the mobile phone while in bed, a few nights per week within the hour before sleep, and hesitancy to switch off the device at night [9,10,11,12]. In addition, bedtime mobile phone use can also be manifested through a frequency of calls and text messages made and/or received after lights out [13]. The use of a mobile phone specifically at night could serve many distinct purposes. However, it has raised concerns, as the period of engagement during the hours before sleep is alarming [9,10], with about 68% of young adults reporting a regular usage of such a device in bed [14].

1.3. Impacts of Bedtime Mobile Phone Use on Cognitive Functioning, Sleep Quality, and Academic Achievement

Among various domains of cognitive functioning, research has found attention and memory to be most closely associated with mobile phone use. The exposure to light-emitting devices at night could have a negative impact on attention and verbal memory [15,16]. The use of mobile phone at night leads to loss of mental attention and decline in other areas of cognitive performance, such as memory, due to feeling of fatigue and tiredness [17].

Bedtime mobile phone use could negatively affect academic performance [18]. The development of the educational system in accordance with technological advancements has led to an increase in mobile phone use for academic purposes. The traditional method of studying and reading books has been substituted with an alternative method of instant fingertip access such as the use of electronic books, online journals, and internet-based studying applications such as MedCalc, Prognosis, and Lexicomp [2,19]. This has contributed to a change in the pattern of mobile phone use, during and after school hours. Students have higher levels of engagement with this device at night for studying purposes and subsequently engaging in free night calls, chatting, instant messaging, and social media that are reportedly influencing their academic performance [2].

Researchers have conducted a great deal of studies relating mobile phone use during bedtime and sleep quality in children and adolescents [6,9,20]. Mobile phones are commonly kept on the bed or beside the bed while sleeping, resulting in difficulty falling asleep due to constant awakening by notifications and trouble switching off the phone during bedtime [18]. Moderate use of the device at night prior to bedtime could contribute to poor sleep quality [10]. Exposure to the light emitted by the mobile phone device causes melatonin suppression and increases the rate of stimulation in the circadian system, leading to sleep issues [20,21]. Individuals with sleep issues such as insomnia might have high engagement of bedtime mobile phone use to pass the time [22].

1.4. Control Variables

Based on the existing findings, sociodemographic variables such as gender [13], age [23], and ethnicity [1,24] can play a role in predicting cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality. Control variables are included in the present study to account for the effects of additional variables that may influence outcome variables.

1.5. The Present Study

The current study aimed to address at least three research gaps. First, young adults have the highest level of mobile phone engagement among all demographic groups [1,25], yet research on mobile phone use has been primarily limited to adolescents and children [14,25,26]. In the present study, we identified undergraduate students as our study population. Second, in the absence of a reliable and valid measurement, it is difficult if not impossible to assess bedtime mobile phone use among young adults. Informed by Exelmans and Bulck [13], we developed a scale for assessing bedtime mobile phone use in the present sample. Third, numerous studies have examined the relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and isolated domains of cognitive functioning [16,23]. Few studies have simultaneously examined the relationships between bedtime mobile phone use and multiple domains of cognitive functioning. In response, we included attention and verbal memory as domains of cognitive functioning. These taken together, the primary purpose of the present study was to examine the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality in a sample of undergraduate students. We hypothesized that bedtime mobile phone use would improve the prediction of cognitive functioning (attention and verbal memory), academic performance, and sleep quality beyond that provided by gender, age, and ethnicity.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants

Three hundred and eighty-five undergraduate students (73% female and 27% male) across eight different faculties at Universiti Putra Malaysia participated in this study. Participants were selected via the multistage stratified sampling method. The mean age of the sample was 21 years (SD = 1.11), ranging from 20–24 years old. Ethnicity breakdown for the sample revealed that 73.8% of the participants were Bumiputera and 26.2% were non-Bumiputera.

The sample size was calculated based on Lemeshow’s (1990) recommendations [27]. A sample of 385 participants was needed in the present study. Exclusion criteria for participation in the present study were students with a history of sleep medication in the past month which could affect the outcome of the study and absentees on the day of data collection. Inclusion criteria for participation in the present study were the following: Years 1 and 2 Malaysian undergraduate students aged between 20–24 years old, availability of GPA as a means of academic performance, possession of a mobile phone, and signed informed consent.

2.2. Procedure

Data collection was carried out in a closed room to ensure that there were no external distractions. Participants were briefed about the study objective and were given an informed consent form. After obtaining informed consent, participants were requested to fill in a self-administered questionnaire on sociodemographics, bedtime mobile phone use, and sleep quality. In the self-administered questionnaire, we asked participants to provide their matrix number to gain access to their GPA. Information on GPA score was obtained from the academic department with permission from the Head of Academic Governance Division, Universiti Putra Malaysia. Participants were given an iPad with an automated installation of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) to complete a series of cognitive tests. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed first, followed by the CANTAB assessment to prevent any cognitive interference.

2.3. Consent

We sought ethical approval by Ethics Committee for Research involving Human Subjects, Universiti Putra Malaysia prior to data collection. Permission and approval from each participating faculty was also obtained. Participation was strictly voluntary, and informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to data collection.

2.4. Measures
2.4.1. Sociodemographics

Participants’ information on sociodemographics such as gender, age, and ethnicity were obtained.

2.4.2. Cognitive Functioning

The CANTAB has varying test measures that cover cognitive functioning domains such as attention, memory, executive function, decision making, and social cognition [28]. Due to the focus of the present study, we only administered Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) to assess attention and Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM) to assess verbal memory.

RVP

We used RVP to assess participants’ attention. In the present study, participants took about seven minutes to complete the test. During test administration, participants were represented with a white box displayed at the center of the screen. Digits ranging from 2–9 appeared in a pseudo-random order at a rate of 100 digits per minute inside the white box. Participants were required to detect the sequence (e.g., two–four–six, three–five–seven, four–six–eight). They then responded to the target sequence by selecting the center button of the displayed screen as quickly as possible. Possible scores range from 0–1. Higher scores indicate better attention [29].

VRM

We used the VRM Immediate Recognition and the VRM Delayed Recognition tests to assess participants’ verbal memory in the present study. Participants took about ten minutes to complete the tests. For the VRM Immediate Recognition test, participants were presented with a sequence of words on the screen one at a time. They were requested to recall the words. For the VRM Delayed Recognition tests, participants were presented with two words (one was from the original list and the other one was a distractor). They were asked to choose the words that they had seen before. For both tests, participants received scores for the correct response. Possible scores range from 0–36 for each test. Individual scores on the VRM Immediate Recognition and the VRM Delayed Recognition tests were summed to obtain a total score on verbal memory. Higher scores indicate better verbal memory [30].

2.4.3. Academic Performance

Participants’ GPA was obtained from the academic department of Universiti Putra Malaysia. The alphabetic grade was determined based on the mark obtained by undergraduate students for a specific course. No personal identifiers were obtained. Higher GPA indicates better academic performance.

2.4.4. Sleep Quality

The 19-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality [31]. A global score was produced by summing up all PSQI items [32]. Possible scores range from 0–21. Cronbach alpha was 0.75 for the PSQI in the present study.

2.4.5. Bedtime Mobile Phone Use Scale

Based on Exelmans and Bulck [13], we developed a 6-item scale to measure bedtime mobile phone use in the present study (Supplementary Materials). Permission to modify the scale was obtained from the original scale developers. Participants were asked to indicate the frequency at which they engaged in bedtime mobile phone use during the last 30 days. As with Exelmans and Bulck [13], all items are scaled on 1 (never), 2 (one to three times a month), 3 (once a week), and 4 (several times a week), and 5 (everyday). A sample item reads: “How frequently do you send text messages after lights out?”. A total score was calculated by summing up the 6 items. Possible scores range from 6–30. As far as the psychometric properties of the scale are concerned, we first calculated the I-CVI (item content validity index for items) and the S-CVI (content validity index for scales) to establish content validity [33] and then obtained Cronbach alpha to establish internal consistency. Both the I-CVI and the SCI indices were 1, thereby establishing content validity. Cronbach alpha values of above 0.70 are referred to as acceptable and above 0.80 as high [34]. Cronbach alpha for the Bedtime Mobile Phone Use Scale (BMPUS) in the present study was high (α = 0.89). Preliminary evidence of validity and reliability was obtained. The BMPUS was found to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing bedtime mobile phone in the present study.

2.5. Data Analytic Plan

Data were checked for missing and out of range values. Normality of the present study and univariate outliers were assessed through measure of skewness and kurtosis following Kline’s recommendations [34]. We performed Pearson’s r correlation tests for bivariate analyses. As for the multivariate analysis, we performed a series of hierarchical multiple regression analysis with cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality as dependent variables. Sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity were included in the analyses as control variables. Gender, age, and ethnicity were entered in Step 1, followed by bedtime mobile phone use in Step 2. Assumptions of multicollinearity were tested based on tolerance (>2) and variance inflation factor (VIF) (<10) values [35]. Multivariate outliers were assessed with the Mahalanobis distance using the regression function. The acceptable range of a critical χ2 value with a degree of freedom of three was 16.27 [35]. We used the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)® Version 25 to perform all statistical analyses. All statistical significance levels were set at p < 0.05.

3.3. Hierarchical Regression Analyses

Table 3 shows the results of hierarchal regression analyses with cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality as dependent variables, while accounting for gender, age, and ethnicity. In the present sample, no violation of multicollinearity assumption was detected as all tolerance and VIF values were within an acceptable range (see Table 3). Multivariate outliers were assessed with Mahalanobis distance using the regression function. The critical chi-square (χ2) value with a degree of freedom of three was 16.27, suggesting no violation of multivariate outlier.

3.3.1. Predicting Cognitive Functioning

In Step 1, gender, age, and ethnicity were not found to be significant predictors for attention and verbal memory. In Step 2, bedtime mobile phone was also not found to be predictive of attention and verbal memory.

3.3.2. Predicting Academic Performance

As shown in Step 1, age and ethnicity were found to be significant predictors for academic performance. In Step 2, addition of bedtime mobile phone use made a significant contribution in predicting academic performance, accounting for an additional 1% of the variance in academic performance. Age and ethnicity retained their statistical significance.

3.3.3. Predicting Sleep Quality

In Step 1, age and ethnicity were found to be significant predictors for sleep quality. In Step 2, addition of bedtime mobile phone use made a significant contribution in predicting sleep quality, accounting for an additional 3% of the variance in sleep quality. Only age retained its statistical significance.

4. Discussion

The present study examined the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality in an undergraduate sample. At bivariate level, increased scores in bedtime mobile phone use were significantly correlated with decreased scores in academic performance and sleep quality. The findings from hierarchical regression analyses show that addition of bedtime mobile use significantly explained and increased variance in each outcome. However, coupled with sociodemographic variables, bedtime mobile phone use collectively predicted 10% of variance in academic performance and 6% of variance in sleep quality, suggesting that the remaining explanatory power in both outcome variables could be due to emotional factors such as mood [8,20,36] that needs to be fully studied in future research.

No significant relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and cognitive functioning was reported. In particular, bedtime mobile phone use was not significantly correlated with attention and verbal memory. This finding concurs with Schoeni et al. [23]. It is possible that selection bias could be present, whereby individuals who prefer to use mobile phone at night are those with higher cognitive functioning [23]. Cognitive functioning is a multidimensional construct. However, only participants’ attention and verbal memory were assessed in the present study. Inclusion of these two cognitive functioning variables alone may not be sufficient to assess its relationship with bedtime mobile phone use [37].

Our findings show that high bedtime mobile phone use was associated with low academic performance. These findings were in line with those of previous research [2,18,38,39,40]. Advancements of technology have altered the traditional methods of studying, resulting in higher engagement with technological devices for educational purposes [2,19]. This could lead to higher engagement with bedtime mobile phone use to seek information or assist with learning needs after school hours. Subsequently, individuals have a higher tendency of being absent or late for classes owing to feeling of sleepiness [18].

A global PSQI score of >5, as suggested by Buysse et al. [31], is indicative of poor sleep quality. In the present sample, 85.2% of the participants rated their sleep quality as poor. This finding is in line with previous studies examining the relation between mobile phone use and sleep quality [13,14,41]. In particular, our findings corroborate previously published results that found high bedtime mobile phone use was associated with low sleep quality [13,14,41,42]. It is now a common trend that individuals keep their mobile phone on or close to their bed during bedtime [18]. In this regard, constant notifications keep them awake resulting in an increased mobile phone use during bedtime. Using the mobile phone during bedtime for text-messaging or calling may induce cognitive or emotional arousal, which is said to be the cause of poor sleep quality [21,22,43].

The present study’s findings provide crucial information to promote mobile phone etiquette (mobiquette) in university students. Health education or workshops are beneficial for raising awareness about mobiquette; students should learn some simple etiquette around responsible use of mobile devices as a medium for studying and learning [44]. Sleep applications could help students to set limits on mobile phone use during bedtime. Studies examining the effectiveness of sleep applications for developing healthy sleeping habits have been documented [45]. For example, Sleep Ninja, a cognitive behavior therapy smartphone application, has been developed to help young people to improve sleep quality while setting limitations to mobile phone use during bedtime [11].

Limitations and Recommendations

The present study has several limitations. First, the CANTAB offers a varying number of cognitive assessments. However, only two cognitive functioning domains, attention and verbal memory, were assessed in the present study. Other cognitive functioning domains such as executive functioning, decision making, and social cognition could be assessed in future studies to further explain the bedtime mobile phone use–cognitive functioning relationship [37]. Second, sole reliance on a self-reported questionnaire may result in response bias. In the present study, data on participants’ sleep quality and bedtime mobile phone use were obtained using the self-report method. Collecting information on bedtime mobile phone use via mobile phone log or accelerometer data from the smartphone would improve data accuracy [20,23]. Objective sleep measures such as actigraphy and polysomnogram could be used to assess sleep quality [46,47]. Third, the relation of bedtime mobile phone use to sleep quality is said to be both bidirectional and complex [25]. Future researchers should consider a longitudinal study design to examine the bidirectional relationship of bedtime mobile phone use to sleep quality. Fourth, in the present study, we focused only on mobile phones and did not collect data on other electronic devices. It is possible that the use of tablets or other electronic devices and related activities could serve as a moderator in the relationship between sleep quality, academic performance, cognitive functioning, and mobile phone use. Fifth, we did not measure mood or record any diagnoses of sleep, medical, or psychiatric disorders. Future mobile phone use research would benefit from the inclusion of measures of mood and psychiatric functioning. Last but not least, we developed the BMPUS to assess bedtime mobile phone use in the present study. Only preliminary evidence of content validity and internal consistency was obtained. The scale awaits future psychometric investigations following established requirements [48].

5. Conclusions

Bedtime mobile phone use is a relatively new topic in media studies, and this study represents the first step toward understanding the emergence of bedtime mobile phone use. We attempted to investigate the effect of bedtime mobile phone use on cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality in a sample of undergraduate students. Our findings show that higher scores in bedtime mobile phone use uniquely predicted lower scores in academic performance and sleep quality, while adjusting for the effect of gender, age, and ethnicity. Further untangling the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to academic performance and sleep quality may prove complex. Future studies with longitudinal data are needed to examine the bidirectional effect that bedtime mobile phone use may have on academic performance and sleep quality.

Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the use of mobile phones has proliferated and brought with it a great influence on human communication through its rapid advancement [1,2]. Mobile phones are well received by users for two reasons: (a) multifunctionality: mobile phones are equipped with features such as an alarm clock, music player, games, internet, short message service (SMS), and video call, and (b) availability: mobile phones have become ubiquitous, enabling individuals to connect instantly and to engage in real-time communication at any time [3,4,5]. For these reasons, mobile phone is said to have the highest percentage of availability in the bedroom at night compared to other technological devices [6].\n\n1.1. Mobile Phone Use in Young Adults\n\nMobile phones have attracted users of all ages. However, mobile phones are known to be vastly popular among young adults. A survey by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission [7] revealed that mobile phone use is dominated by young adults compared to teenagers, older adults, and senior citizens. To this end, mobile phones are particularly well received by university students for two reasons. First, mobile phones have become vital among university students as they accommodate their need of information-seeking and provide educational assistance. Second, mobile phone applications provide university students with access to instant communication and social media (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram) at any point of the day [8].\n\n1.2. Bedtime Mobile Phone Use\n\nBedtime mobile phone use is defined as constant use of the mobile phone while in bed, a few nights per week within the hour before sleep, and hesitancy to switch off the device at night [9,10,11,12]. In addition, bedtime mobile phone use can also be manifested through a frequency of calls and text messages made and/or received after lights out [13]. The use of a mobile phone specifically at night could serve many distinct purposes. However, it has raised concerns, as the period of engagement during the hours before sleep is alarming [9,10], with about 68% of young adults reporting a regular usage of such a device in bed [14].\n\n1.3. Impacts of Bedtime Mobile Phone Use on Cognitive Functioning, Sleep Quality, and Academic Achievement\n\nAmong various domains of cognitive functioning, research has found attention and memory to be most closely associated with mobile phone use. The exposure to light-emitting devices at night could have a negative impact on attention and verbal memory [15,16]. The use of mobile phone at night leads to loss of mental attention and decline in other areas of cognitive performance, such as memory, due to feeling of fatigue and tiredness [17].\n\nBedtime mobile phone use could negatively affect academic performance [18]. The development of the educational system in accordance with technological advancements has led to an increase in mobile phone use for academic purposes. The traditional method of studying and reading books has been substituted with an alternative method of instant fingertip access such as the use of electronic books, online journals, and internet-based studying applications such as MedCalc, Prognosis, and Lexicomp [2,19]. This has contributed to a change in the pattern of mobile phone use, during and after school hours. Students have higher levels of engagement with this device at night for studying purposes and subsequently engaging in free night calls, chatting, instant messaging, and social media that are reportedly influencing their academic performance [2].\n\nResearchers have conducted a great deal of studies relating mobile phone use during bedtime and sleep quality in children and adolescents [6,9,20]. Mobile phones are commonly kept on the bed or beside the bed while sleeping, resulting in difficulty falling asleep due to constant awakening by notifications and trouble switching off the phone during bedtime [18]. Moderate use of the device at night prior to bedtime could contribute to poor sleep quality [10]. Exposure to the light emitted by the mobile phone device causes melatonin suppression and increases the rate of stimulation in the circadian system, leading to sleep issues [20,21]. Individuals with sleep issues such as insomnia might have high engagement of bedtime mobile phone use to pass the time [22].\n\n1.4. Control Variables\n\nBased on the existing findings, sociodemographic variables such as gender [13], age [23], and ethnicity [1,24] can play a role in predicting cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality. Control variables are included in the present study to account for the effects of additional variables that may influence outcome variables.\n\n1.5. The Present Study\n\nThe current study aimed to address at least three research gaps. First, young adults have the highest level of mobile phone engagement among all demographic groups [1,25], yet research on mobile phone use has been primarily limited to adolescents and children [14,25,26]. In the present study, we identified undergraduate students as our study population. Second, in the absence of a reliable and valid measurement, it is difficult if not impossible to assess bedtime mobile phone use among young adults. Informed by Exelmans and Bulck [13], we developed a scale for assessing bedtime mobile phone use in the present sample. Third, numerous studies have examined the relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and isolated domains of cognitive functioning [16,23]. Few studies have simultaneously examined the relationships between bedtime mobile phone use and multiple domains of cognitive functioning. In response, we included attention and verbal memory as domains of cognitive functioning. These taken together, the primary purpose of the present study was to examine the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality in a sample of undergraduate students. We hypothesized that bedtime mobile phone use would improve the prediction of cognitive functioning (attention and verbal memory), academic performance, and sleep quality beyond that provided by gender, age, and ethnicity.\n\n2. Methods\n2.1. Participants\n\nThree hundred and eighty-five undergraduate students (73% female and 27% male) across eight different faculties at Universiti Putra Malaysia participated in this study. Participants were selected via the multistage stratified sampling method. The mean age of the sample was 21 years (SD = 1.11), ranging from 20–24 years old. Ethnicity breakdown for the sample revealed that 73.8% of the participants were Bumiputera and 26.2% were non-Bumiputera.\n\nThe sample size was calculated based on Lemeshow’s (1990) recommendations [27]. A sample of 385 participants was needed in the present study. Exclusion criteria for participation in the present study were students with a history of sleep medication in the past month which could affect the outcome of the study and absentees on the day of data collection. Inclusion criteria for participation in the present study were the following: Years 1 and 2 Malaysian undergraduate students aged between 20–24 years old, availability of GPA as a means of academic performance, possession of a mobile phone, and signed informed consent.\n\n2.2. Procedure\n\nData collection was carried out in a closed room to ensure that there were no external distractions. Participants were briefed about the study objective and were given an informed consent form. After obtaining informed consent, participants were requested to fill in a self-administered questionnaire on sociodemographics, bedtime mobile phone use, and sleep quality. In the self-administered questionnaire, we asked participants to provide their matrix number to gain access to their GPA. Information on GPA score was obtained from the academic department with permission from the Head of Academic Governance Division, Universiti Putra Malaysia. Participants were given an iPad with an automated installation of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) to complete a series of cognitive tests. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed first, followed by the CANTAB assessment to prevent any cognitive interference.\n\n2.3. Consent\n\nWe sought ethical approval by Ethics Committee for Research involving Human Subjects, Universiti Putra Malaysia prior to data collection. Permission and approval from each participating faculty was also obtained. Participation was strictly voluntary, and informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to data collection.\n\n2.4. Measures\n2.4.1. Sociodemographics\n\nParticipants’ information on sociodemographics such as gender, age, and ethnicity were obtained.\n\n2.4.2. Cognitive Functioning\n\nThe CANTAB has varying test measures that cover cognitive functioning domains such as attention, memory, executive function, decision making, and social cognition [28]. Due to the focus of the present study, we only administered Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) to assess attention and Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM) to assess verbal memory.\n\nRVP\n\nWe used RVP to assess participants’ attention. In the present study, participants took about seven minutes to complete the test. During test administration, participants were represented with a white box displayed at the center of the screen. Digits ranging from 2–9 appeared in a pseudo-random order at a rate of 100 digits per minute inside the white box. Participants were required to detect the sequence (e.g., two–four–six, three–five–seven, four–six–eight). They then responded to the target sequence by selecting the center button of the displayed screen as quickly as possible. Possible scores range from 0–1. Higher scores indicate better attention [29].\n\nVRM\n\nWe used the VRM Immediate Recognition and the VRM Delayed Recognition tests to assess participants’ verbal memory in the present study. Participants took about ten minutes to complete the tests. For the VRM Immediate Recognition test, participants were presented with a sequence of words on the screen one at a time. They were requested to recall the words. For the VRM Delayed Recognition tests, participants were presented with two words (one was from the original list and the other one was a distractor). They were asked to choose the words that they had seen before. For both tests, participants received scores for the correct response. Possible scores range from 0–36 for each test. Individual scores on the VRM Immediate Recognition and the VRM Delayed Recognition tests were summed to obtain a total score on verbal memory. Higher scores indicate better verbal memory [30].\n\n2.4.3. Academic Performance\n\nParticipants’ GPA was obtained from the academic department of Universiti Putra Malaysia. The alphabetic grade was determined based on the mark obtained by undergraduate students for a specific course. No personal identifiers were obtained. Higher GPA indicates better academic performance.\n\n2.4.4. Sleep Quality\n\nThe 19-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality [31]. A global score was produced by summing up all PSQI items [32]. Possible scores range from 0–21. Cronbach alpha was 0.75 for the PSQI in the present study.\n\n2.4.5. Bedtime Mobile Phone Use Scale\n\nBased on Exelmans and Bulck [13], we developed a 6-item scale to measure bedtime mobile phone use in the present study (Supplementary Materials). Permission to modify the scale was obtained from the original scale developers. Participants were asked to indicate the frequency at which they engaged in bedtime mobile phone use during the last 30 days. As with Exelmans and Bulck [13], all items are scaled on 1 (never), 2 (one to three times a month), 3 (once a week), and 4 (several times a week), and 5 (everyday). A sample item reads: “How frequently do you send text messages after lights out?”. A total score was calculated by summing up the 6 items. Possible scores range from 6–30. As far as the psychometric properties of the scale are concerned, we first calculated the I-CVI (item content validity index for items) and the S-CVI (content validity index for scales) to establish content validity [33] and then obtained Cronbach alpha to establish internal consistency. Both the I-CVI and the SCI indices were 1, thereby establishing content validity. Cronbach alpha values of above 0.70 are referred to as acceptable and above 0.80 as high [34]. Cronbach alpha for the Bedtime Mobile Phone Use Scale (BMPUS) in the present study was high (α = 0.89). Preliminary evidence of validity and reliability was obtained. The BMPUS was found to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing bedtime mobile phone in the present study.\n\n2.5. Data Analytic Plan\n\nData were checked for missing and out of range values. Normality of the present study and univariate outliers were assessed through measure of skewness and kurtosis following Kline’s recommendations [34]. We performed Pearson’s r correlation tests for bivariate analyses. As for the multivariate analysis, we performed a series of hierarchical multiple regression analysis with cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality as dependent variables. Sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity were included in the analyses as control variables. Gender, age, and ethnicity were entered in Step 1, followed by bedtime mobile phone use in Step 2. Assumptions of multicollinearity were tested based on tolerance (>2) and variance inflation factor (VIF) (<10) values [35]. Multivariate outliers were assessed with the Mahalanobis distance using the regression function. The acceptable range of a critical χ2 value with a degree of freedom of three was 16.27 [35]. We used the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)® Version 25 to perform all statistical analyses. All statistical significance levels were set at p < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n3.1.

Hierarchical Regression Analyses\n\nTable 3 shows the results of hierarchal regression analyses with cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality as dependent variables, while accounting for gender, age, and ethnicity. In the present sample, no violation of multicollinearity assumption was detected as all tolerance and VIF values were within an acceptable range (see Table 3). Multivariate outliers were assessed with Mahalanobis distance using the regression function. The critical chi-square (χ2) value with a degree of freedom of three was 16.27, suggesting no violation of multivariate outlier.\n\nTable 3.\n\nHierarchical multiple regression predicting cognitive functioning (attention and verbal memory), academic performance, and sleep quality (n = 385).\n\n\tAttention\tVerbal Memory\tAcademic Performance\tSleep Quality\nPredictors\tb\tSEb\tβ\tT\tVIF\tb\tSEb\tβ\tT\tVIF\tb\tSEb\tβ\tT\tVIF\tb\tSEb\tβ\tT\tVIF\nStep 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGender\t−0.01\t0.02\t−0.03\t0.99\t1.0\t−0.58\t0.60\t−0.05\t0.99\t1.0\t0.05\t0.04\t0.07\t0.99\t1.0\t−0.07\t0.32\t−0.01\t0.99\t1.0\nAge\t0.01\t0.01\t0.06\t0.98\t1.0\t0.01\t0.24\t0.002\t0.98\t1.0\t−0.04\t0.02\t−0.12 *\t0.98\t1.0\t−0.32\t0.11\t−0.13 *\t0.98\t1.0\nEthnicity\t0.03\t0.03\t0.08\t0.98\t1.0\t1.3\t0.61\t0.11\t0.98\t1.0\t0.20\t0.04\t0.29 ***\t0.98\t1.0\t−0.70\t0.33\t−0.11 *\t0.98\t1.0\nΔR2\t0.01\t\t\t\t\t0.01\t\t\t\t\t0.01 ***\t\t\t\t\t0.03 *\t\t\t\t\nStep 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGender\t−0.01\t0.02\t−0.02\t0.99\t1.0\t−0.54\t0.61\t−0.05\t0.99\t1.0\t0.06\t0.04\t0.08\t0.99\t1.0\t−0.17\t0.32\t−0.03\t0.99\t1.0\nAge\t0.01\t0.01\t0.06\t0.98\t1.0\t0.02\t0.24\t0.003\t0.98\t1.0\t−0.04\t0.02\t−1.2 *\t0.98\t1.0\t−0.34\t0.13\t−1.3 **\t0.98\t1.0\nEthnicity\t0.02\t0.02\t0.06\t0.91\t1.1\t1.2\t0.64\t0.01\t0.91\t1.1\t0.20\t0.04\t0.26 ***\t0.91\t1.1\t−0.37\t0.33\t−0.06\t0.91\t1.1\nBMPU\t−0.001\t0.001\t−0.06\t0.92\t1.1\t−0.03\t0.05\t−0.03\t0.92\t1.1\t−0.01\t0.003\t−0.11 *\t0.92\t1.1\t0.09\t0.03\t0.18 **\t0.92\t1.1\nΔR2\t0.01\t\t\t\t\t0.02\t\t\t\t\t0.10 ***\t\t\t\t\t0.06 ***\t\t\t\t\nOpen in a new tab\n\nNote. b = beta values; SEb = standard error beta values; β = standardized beta values; ΔR2 = R square change; VIF = variance inflation factor; Gender (1 = Male); ethnicity (1 = Bumiputra); BMPU = bedtime mobile phone use; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.\n\n3.3.1. Predicting Cognitive Functioning\n\nIn Step 1, gender, age, and ethnicity were not found to be significant predictors for attention and verbal memory. In Step 2, bedtime mobile phone was also not found to be predictive of attention and verbal memory.\n\n3.3.2. Predicting Academic Performance\n\nAs shown in Step 1, age and ethnicity were found to be significant predictors for academic performance. In Step 2, addition of bedtime mobile phone use made a significant contribution in predicting academic performance, accounting for an additional 1% of the variance in academic performance. Age and ethnicity retained their statistical significance.\n\n3.3.3. Predicting Sleep Quality\n\nIn Step 1, age and ethnicity were found to be significant predictors for sleep quality. In Step 2, addition of bedtime mobile phone use made a significant contribution in predicting sleep quality, accounting for an additional 3% of the variance in sleep quality. Only age retained its statistical significance.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe present study examined the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality in an undergraduate sample. At bivariate level, increased scores in bedtime mobile phone use were significantly correlated with decreased scores in academic performance and sleep quality. The findings from hierarchical regression analyses show that addition of bedtime mobile use significantly explained and increased variance in each outcome. However, coupled with sociodemographic variables, bedtime mobile phone use collectively predicted 10% of variance in academic performance and 6% of variance in sleep quality, suggesting that the remaining explanatory power in both outcome variables could be due to emotional factors such as mood [8,20,36] that needs to be fully studied in future research.\n\nNo significant relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and cognitive functioning was reported. In particular, bedtime mobile phone use was not significantly correlated with attention and verbal memory. This finding concurs with Schoeni et al. [23]. It is possible that selection bias could be present, whereby individuals who prefer to use mobile phone at night are those with higher cognitive functioning [23]. Cognitive functioning is a multidimensional construct. However, only participants’ attention and verbal memory were assessed in the present study. Inclusion of these two cognitive functioning variables alone may not be sufficient to assess its relationship with bedtime mobile phone use [37].\n\nOur findings show that high bedtime mobile phone use was associated with low academic performance. These findings were in line with those of previous research [2,18,38,39,40]. Advancements of technology have altered the traditional methods of studying, resulting in higher engagement with technological devices for educational purposes [2,19]. This could lead to higher engagement with bedtime mobile phone use to seek information or assist with learning needs after school hours. Subsequently, individuals have a higher tendency of being absent or late for classes owing to feeling of sleepiness [18].\n\nA global PSQI score of >5, as suggested by Buysse et al. [31], is indicative of poor sleep quality. In the present sample, 85.2% of the participants rated their sleep quality as poor. This finding is in line with previous studies examining the relation between mobile phone use and sleep quality [13,14,41]. In particular, our findings corroborate previously published results that found high bedtime mobile phone use was associated with low sleep quality [13,14,41,42]. It is now a common trend that individuals keep their mobile phone on or close to their bed during bedtime [18]. In this regard, constant notifications keep them awake resulting in an increased mobile phone use during bedtime. Using the mobile phone during bedtime for text-messaging or calling may induce cognitive or emotional arousal, which is said to be the cause of poor sleep quality [21,22,43].\n\nThe present study’s findings provide crucial information to promote mobile phone etiquette (mobiquette) in university students. Health education or workshops are beneficial for raising awareness about mobiquette; students should learn some simple etiquette around responsible use of mobile devices as a medium for studying and learning [44]. Sleep applications could help students to set limits on mobile phone use during bedtime. Studies examining the effectiveness of sleep applications for developing healthy sleeping habits have been documented [45]. For example, Sleep Ninja, a cognitive behavior therapy smartphone application, has been developed to help young people to improve sleep quality while setting limitations to mobile phone use during bedtime [11].\n\nLimitations and Recommendations\n\nThe present study has several limitations. First, the CANTAB offers a varying number of cognitive assessments. However, only two cognitive functioning domains, attention and verbal memory, were assessed in the present study. Other cognitive functioning domains such as executive functioning, decision making, and social cognition could be assessed in future studies to further explain the bedtime mobile phone use–cognitive functioning relationship [37]. Second, sole reliance on a self-reported questionnaire may result in response bias. In the present study, data on participants’ sleep quality and bedtime mobile phone use were obtained using the self-report method. Collecting information on bedtime mobile phone use via mobile phone log or accelerometer data from the smartphone would improve data accuracy [20,23]. Objective sleep measures such as actigraphy and polysomnogram could be used to assess sleep quality [46,47]. Third, the relation of bedtime mobile phone use to sleep quality is said to be both bidirectional and complex [25]. Future researchers should consider a longitudinal study design to examine the bidirectional relationship of bedtime mobile phone use to sleep quality. Fourth, in the present study, we focused only on mobile phones and did not collect data on other electronic devices. It is possible that the use of tablets or other electronic devices and related activities could serve as a moderator in the relationship between sleep quality, academic performance, cognitive functioning, and mobile phone use. Fifth, we did not measure mood or record any diagnoses of sleep, medical, or psychiatric disorders. Future mobile phone use research would benefit from the inclusion of measures of mood and psychiatric functioning. Last but not least, we developed the BMPUS to assess bedtime mobile phone use in the present study. Only preliminary evidence of content validity and internal consistency was obtained. The scale awaits future psychometric investigations following established requirements [48].\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nBedtime mobile phone use is a relatively new topic in media studies, and this study represents the first step toward understanding the emergence of bedtime mobile phone use. We attempted to investigate the effect of bedtime mobile phone use on cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality in a sample of undergraduate students. Our findings show that higher scores in bedtime mobile phone use uniquely predicted lower scores in academic performance and sleep quality, while adjusting for the effect of gender, age, and ethnicity. Further untangling the relations of bedtime mobile phone use to academic performance and sleep quality may prove complex. Future studies with longitudinal data are needed to examine the bidirectional effect that bedtime mobile phone use may have on academic performance and sleep quality.\n\nSupplementary Materials\n\nThe following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/19/7131/s1, the Bedtime Mobile Phone Use Scale.\n\nClick here for additional data file.

### Report on the Effects of Nighttime Smartphone Usage on Sleep Quality Among Boarding School Students

#### Introduction
The provided text primarily discusses a study conducted on medical students at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, focusing on the impact of smartphone use at bedtime on sleep quality and academic activities. While the study is not directly about boarding school students, it provides relevant insights into the effects of nighttime smartphone usage on sleep quality, which can be extrapolated to similar populations, such as boarding school students.

#### Study Overview
The study is a cross-sectional analysis involving 1,184 undergraduate medical students. It aims to assess the prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime and its association with sleep quality and educational activities. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was employed to evaluate sleep quality.

#### Key Findings
1. **Prevalence of Smartphone Use**: 
   - A significant 96.5% of students reported using smartphones at bedtime, with nearly half using them for more than two hours.
   - Social media was the most common use (74.2%), followed by communication (48.8%).

2. **Impact on Sleep Quality**:
   - Bedtime smartphone users exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality, increased sleep latency, difficulty maintaining sleep, and shorter sleep duration compared to non-users.
   - Approximately 64.2% of bedtime smartphone users were classified as poor sleepers based on the PSQI.

3. **Factors Influencing Sleep Quality**:
   - Poor sleep quality was associated with regular coffee consumption, hostel residence, and proximity of the phone during sleep.
   - Physical activity was found to reduce the likelihood of poor sleep quality.

4. **Academic Performance**:
   - Poor sleepers reported greater academic difficulties, including morning fatigue, decreased concentration, and lower exam grades.

#### Discussion
The study highlights the negative impact of smartphone use at bedtime on sleep quality, which in turn affects academic performance. The findings suggest that the light emitted from smartphones and the cognitive engagement they provide can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to sleep deprivation and its associated cognitive impairments.

#### Conclusion
While the study focuses on medical students, the implications of nighttime smartphone usage on sleep quality are relevant to boarding school students, who may experience similar patterns of smartphone use and its effects. Limiting smartphone use before bedtime is recommended to improve sleep quality and academic performance.

#### Recommendations
- **Education**: Students should be educated about the adverse effects of nighttime smartphone use on sleep and academic performance.
- **Policy Implementation**: Boarding schools could implement policies to restrict smartphone use during late hours.
- **Encouragement of Physical Activity**: Promoting regular physical activity could mitigate some negative effects on sleep quality.

This report underscores the importance of addressing smartphone usage habits among students to foster better sleep hygiene and academic outcomes.

The provided text is a comprehensive study examining the relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and its effects on cognitive functioning, academic performance, and sleep quality among undergraduate students. The study involved 385 undergraduate students from Universiti Putra Malaysia and utilized a self-administered questionnaire and cognitive tests to gather data.

Key findings from the study include:

1. **Bedtime Mobile Phone Use and Academic Performance**: The study found that increased bedtime mobile phone use was significantly correlated with decreased academic performance. This suggests that students who frequently use their mobile phones at bedtime tend to have lower academic achievements. The study highlights that technological advancements have led to increased mobile phone use for educational purposes, which may extend into bedtime, affecting academic performance negatively.

2. **Bedtime Mobile Phone Use and Sleep Quality**: The study also found a significant negative correlation between bedtime mobile phone use and sleep quality. High usage of mobile phones at bedtime was associated with poor sleep quality, as indicated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The study notes that the light emitted by mobile phones can suppress melatonin and disrupt the circadian system, leading to sleep issues.

3. **Cognitive Functioning**: The study did not find a significant relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and cognitive functioning, specifically attention and verbal memory. This suggests that while bedtime mobile phone use affects academic performance and sleep quality, its impact on cognitive functioning may be less direct or influenced by other factors.

4. **Control Variables**: The study controlled for sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity, which were found to have varying degrees of influence on the outcomes. For instance, age and ethnicity were significant predictors of academic performance and sleep quality.

5. **Recommendations**: The study suggests promoting mobile phone etiquette (mobiquette) among university students to mitigate the negative impacts of bedtime mobile phone use. It also recommends the use of sleep applications to help students manage their mobile phone use during bedtime.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the negative impacts of bedtime mobile phone use on academic performance and sleep quality among undergraduate students. However, it does not directly address the specific question of how restricted smartphone access after bedtime impacts the academic performance of boarding school students compared to those with unrestricted access. Further research would be needed to explore this specific comparison.

### Requirements
Please provide a detailed research report in response to the following topic: "What are the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among boarding school students, and how do these effects compare to students who have restricted phone access after bedtime?", using the information provided above. The report must meet the following requirements:

- Focus on directly addressing the chosen topic.
- Ensure a well-structured and in-depth presentation, incorporating relevant facts and figures where available.
- Present data and findings in an intuitive manner, utilizing feature comparative tables, if applicable.
- The report should have a minimum word count of 2,000 and be formatted with Markdown syntax following APA style guidelines.
- Include all source URLs in APA format at the end of the report.

Abstract
Background & objectives:

Several studies have been conducted globally to assess the impact of usage of mobile phones on quality and duration of sleep as also on day time sleepiness. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of mobile phone usage on the quality and composition of sleep in a sample from Indian population.

Methods:

The study was conducted at two tertiary care hospitals in north India from July 2014 to September 2019. A total of 566 participants were recruited in this study from both the centres. Sleep quality was assessed with the help of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Subsequently, actigraphy was done in 96 participants and polysomnography in 95 participants.

Results:

Of the 566 participants, 128 (22.61%) had PSQI ≥5, reflecting poor sleep quality. A higher use of mobile phone was significantly associated with a poor sleep quality as a component of PSQI questionnaire (P=0.01) and higher overall PSQI score (P=0.01). The latency from sleep onset to N2 and N3 sleep stages was significantly shorter in participants having a higher mobile phone usage as compared to those with a lower usage [Median (range): 13.5 min (1.5-109) vs. 6.5 min (0-89); P=0.02] and [Median (range): 49 min (8.5-220.5) vs. 28.75 min (0-141); P=0.03], respectively.

Interpretation & conclusions:

This study focused on the maladaptive changes brought on by mobile phone usage on sleep. More studies with larger sample sizes need to be done that may serve to confirm the hypothesis generating findings of our study.

Keywords: Actigraphy, mobile phone, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, polysomnography, sleep

The usage of mobile phones in India has increased exponentially. Concerns about exposure to radiation both from phones and telecommunication infrastructure have led to an upsurge of studies examining the potential ill effects1,2,3,4. The plausible effect of excessive mobile phone usage on sleep pattern and quality is also important due to it societal implications5,6. Concerns about the thermal effect of microwaves used in mobile phones are felt to be negligible at the power used by usual mobile phones7. Large epidemiological studies have not found a consistent effect of mobile phone usage on overall mortality except when used in hazardous circumstances like during driving8,9.

To assess the effect of radiation exposure on well-being and sleep, Hutter et al10 performed a cross-sectional study in urban and rural populations living near mobile phone towers in Austria and concluded that symptoms such as headache were common in these populations. However, their study failed to show any significant changes in sleep quality. Subsequent studies showed that exposure to electromagnetic waves and excessive use of mobile phones resulted in disrupted sleep11,12. A cross-sectional study conducted by Demir and Sumer6 in migraine patients in Turkey, demonstrated that mobile phone usage was significantly associated with higher rates of headache, excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality. A similar study to assess the impact of mobile phone usage on sleep in Japanese adolescents found that an increase in use after lights out before sleep was associated with a shorter sleep duration, poorer quality of sleep, insomnia as well as excessive daytime sleepiness13. Similar data are sparse in the Indian population with its distinct genetic and sociocultural characteristics. This study was therefore, conducted to assess the effect of mobile phone usage on the quality and composition of sleep in a representative sample of the Indian population.

Material & Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2014 to September 2019 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. A total of 566 participants were recruited with the aim to see the effect between the frequency of mobile phone use for calls and short message service (SMS) as well as total duration of mobile phone usage on quality of sleep. Participants were enrolled from the outpatient departments, undergraduate hostels and post-graduate hostels at the AIIMS and PGIMER. All adults in the age group 20 to 60 yr who had used mobile phones for more than one year, were eligible for participation in the study. Those who were suffering from any neurologic or psychiatric illness, critically ill patients, chronic alcoholics and smokers, who had any visual or auditory impairment as well as those with a prior diagnosis of metabolic syndrome were excluded. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee of AIIMS and PGIMER and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Measures:

Demographic data: Age, gender and educational qualifications of all participants were recorded. A basic medical history was taken. Mobile phone use was quantified in terms of total number of calls and SMSs received per day for the past 30 days. If the total number of calls and SMSs per day was ³12 or either of these individually exceeded 11, the participant was considered to be a high user11.

Subjective sleep quality: The subjective sleep quality was assessed with the help of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire14. PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over the preceding one month. It has 19 individual items that generate seven component scores in the following domains-subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (SL), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, need to use medications for sleep and daytime dysfunction. A PSQI global score of ≥5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6 per cent and specificity of 86.5 per cent in distinguishing good and poor sleepers14.

Actigraphy: Actigraphy sleep data were collected using the SOMNO watch (Actiwatch Spectrum Plus; Philips Respironics Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA). The monitor provided the estimates of SL, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and the sleep efficiency. SL is defined as the length of time taken to fall asleep - the time between ‘lights off’ to the first period of three minutes of consecutive epochs scored as sleep. WASO refers to the number of minutes awake between sleep onset and time of final waking. Sleep efficiency is defined as the proportion of the estimated sleep periods spent asleep. The data were collected for a period of three days for each participant. The average SL, sleep efficiency and WASO were calculated for period of three days.

Polysomnography (PSG): Polysomnography studies were conducted in the sleep laboratory using Alice 3 or ALICE PDx systems (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA). A continuous polygraphic recording was done from surface electrodes for electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram, thermistors for oral and nasal flow, thoracic and abdominal impedance belts for respiratory efforts, pulse oximetry, tracheal microphone for snoring and sensors for leg and sleep position. PSG records and sleep data were scored as per American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria15. The following sleep parameters were recorded: total sleep time (TST), SL, stage R latency (RL), WASO, time spent in stages N1, N2, N3 and R in per cent of TST and latency from sleep onset to stage N2 and N3.

Statistical analysis: Analysis was done with Stata11.2 (StatCrop LP, College Station; TX, USA). Quantitative variables were presented as mean with standard deviation, median with range and frequency percentage as appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

A total of 566 participants were enrolled with recording of demographic variables and administration of PSQI questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 31.03 ± 9.82 yr. The proportion of male participants was 57.60 per cent. 42.4 per cent of the participants had an undergraduate degree. Based on the number of mobile phone calls and messages received each day, 39 per cent of the participants interviewed had a high daily mobile phone usage (Table I).

Overall, 128 of 566 participants (22.61%) had a subjectively poor sleep with a PSQI ≥ 5. A higher mobile phone usage was seen to be significantly associated with a poor sleep quality as a component of the PSQI questionnaire (P=0.01) and a higher overall PSQI score (P=0.01) (Figure). A subjectively longer SL period, a shorter total sleep duration, poorer sleep efficiency and evident daytime dysfunction were observed to be associated with excessive cell phone use although these trends did not attain significance (Table II).

An objective assessment of sleep by actigraphy was done for 96 participants (Table III). The median SL for all the participants was 27.5 min (Range: 1-155 min). The median sleep efficiency was seen to be lower in those reporting a low total mobile phone usage as compared to high users [Median (range)=37.5% (0-130.5) vs. 75% (3.5-96.8); P=0.04]. Furthermore, the average SL over three days in users with low usage was higher than in those with a high usage [Median (range)=33.17 min (1-155) vs. 22.71 (1-92); P=0.04]. The average WASO for the period of observation was also seen to be higher among low mobile phone users although the difference was not significant.

A polysomnographic study was done for 95 participants (Table IV). The mean TST was 343 ± 93 min with a mean sleep efficiency of 83.1 per cent. The TST, sleep efficiency and SL were similar in the two groups of mobile phone usage. However, the latency from sleep onset to N2 and N3 sleep stages were significantly shorter in participants having a higher mobile phone usage as compared to those with a lower usage [Median (range):13.5 min (1.5-109) vs. 6.5 min (0-89); P=0.02] and [Median (range): 49 min (8.5-220.5) vs. 28.75 min (0-141); P=0.03], respectively.

Discussion

High mobile use is a risk factor for sleep disturbance. Sufficient sleep and recovery is an established predictor of physical and psychological well-being, also among adolescents and young adults16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Sleep disturbances are more prevalent among high mobile phone users due to an increase in SL. Usage of mobile phone at bedtime, significantly increases SL and adversely affects sleep5,23,24. Calls and text messages received during sleeping hours may lead to recurrent night awakenings.

In this study, subjective sleep quality was evaluated with the help of the PSQI questionnaire wherein a score ³5 was indicative of poor sleep. Our findings were coherent with similar studies in the past where exposure to light and altered melatonin metabolism has been implicated in sleep disturbances caused due to mobile phone usage25. In the current study, quantification of mobile phone use was done only by interviewing the study participants. Several studies have used parameters such as average mobile screen usage time, mobile after the lights have been turned off and using mobile in pre bed time etc26,27.

Previous studies have found that mobile phone usage, especially near bedtime worsens sleep quality as assessed by PSQI5,24,28,29. Because PSQI relies on the administration of a questionnaire to assess various parameters, it becomes vulnerable to self-reporting bias26 where participants may give biased answers because of their perspective, beliefs and expectations. Because the degree of usage of mobile phones was based on self-reporting, there might have been under-as well as overestimation27,28,29,30 of the effect of usage on the parameters being studied based on factors such as age, sex and educational qualification31,32.

The actigraphy data showed an increase in sleep efficiency and a decrease in SL in patients with higher mobile phone usage while the average WASO was similar in the two groups. In the PSG subgroup, the sleep efficiency and SL were similar in the two groups. However, the latency to N2 and N3 sleep stages from sleep onset were shorter in the group with higher mobile phone use. These findings appear to be in conflict with the available literature. In a cross-sectional study in 2400 adolescents from 46 schools in Iran, SL was 24±21and 20±18 min in cell phone users and non-users, respectively33, suggesting that cell phone users had significantly higher SL than non-users (P<0.001) similar to our study where higher use for call/SMS was associated with higher sleep latencies.

In a cross-sectional study based on 9846 adolescents from Norway, 90 per cent of the adolescents reported to use their mobile phone in the hour before going to bed and this was related to self-reported sleep onset latency and sleep deficit34. The PSG subgroup showed that TST was non-significantly associated with mobile phone usage with participants with higher mobile phone usage having a reduction in overall sleep time as assessed by PSG.

SL showed a trend towards being higher in cases with high mobile phone use but the difference fell short of being significant. Similar changes were not observed in the WASO parameter. The increase in sleep efficiency and decrease in SL in high mobile phone users on actigraphy may be explained by the possible bias induced on account of being monitored. While being monitored by actigraphy, the participants likely avoided mobile phone use during sleep. As suggested by poor subjective sleep quality among high mobile phone users, it could be possible that this subgroup was sleep deprived and consequently compensated for sleep loss on the preceding days with an increase in sleep efficiency and a decrease in average latency on actigraphy. It has been reported that the effect of sleep deprivation on PSG is a rebound increase in TST, sleep efficiency and increased percentage of N3 sleep along with a decrease in REM latency and SL from lights off35. In PSG in participants with high mobile phone usage, a decrease was found in latency to N2 and N3 from sleep onset. The clinical significance of the same is not clear; however, this may represent an attempt to consolidate sleep and compensate for poor sleep on preceding days36. One may speculate that a first night effect during in-lab PSG might have nullified any effect of mobile phone use on recorded sleep efficiency and SL37.

Our study had certain limitations. We used number of calls and text messages as a measure of total phone use. In recent times, patterns of mobile phone use have changed with increasing use of social media platforms for messaging. A more objective quantification was not feasible as participants were using different makes of the mobile phones, wherein, usage data were not retrievable from the phones uniformly. Several participants had changed their devices in the previous few weeks or months. In conclusion, our study addresses an important question and paves the way for further studies looking at the relationship between all facets of smart phone usage and their impact on objectively measured sleep quality. Though the observational nature of the study may not fully account for all possible confounding factors in subgroups, but, dose-response between sleep quality and mobile phone use observed in our study supports the hypothesis that mobile phone use may alter sleep habits.

The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of mobile phone usage on the quality and composition of sleep in a sample from Indian population.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe study was conducted at two tertiary care hospitals in north India from July 2014 to September 2019. A total of 566 participants were recruited in this study from both the centres. Sleep quality was assessed with the help of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Subsequently, actigraphy was done in 96 participants and polysomnography in 95 participants.\n\nResults:\n\nOf the 566 participants, 128 (22.61%) had PSQI ≥5, reflecting poor sleep quality. A higher use of mobile phone was significantly associated with a poor sleep quality as a component of PSQI questionnaire (P=0.01) and higher overall PSQI score (P=0.01). The latency from sleep onset to N2 and N3 sleep stages was significantly shorter in participants having a higher mobile phone usage as compared to those with a lower usage [Median (range): 13.5 min (1.5-109) vs. 6.5 min (0-89); P=0.02] and [Median (range): 49 min (8.5-220.5) vs. 28.75 min (0-141); P=0.03], respectively.\n\nInterpretation & conclusions:\n\nThis study focused on the maladaptive changes brought on by mobile phone usage on sleep. More studies with larger sample sizes need to be done that may serve to confirm the hypothesis generating findings of our study.\n\nKeywords: Actigraphy, mobile phone, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, polysomnography, sleep\n\nThe usage of mobile phones in India has increased exponentially. Concerns about exposure to radiation both from phones and telecommunication infrastructure have led to an upsurge of studies examining the potential ill effects1,2,3,4. The plausible effect of excessive mobile phone usage on sleep pattern and quality is also important due to it societal implications5,6. Concerns about the thermal effect of microwaves used in mobile phones are felt to be negligible at the power used by usual mobile phones7. Large epidemiological studies have not found a consistent effect of mobile phone usage on overall mortality except when used in hazardous circumstances like during driving8,9.\n\nTo assess the effect of radiation exposure on well-being and sleep, Hutter et al10 performed a cross-sectional study in urban and rural populations living near mobile phone towers in Austria and concluded that symptoms such as headache were common in these populations. However, their study failed to show any significant changes in sleep quality. Subsequent studies showed that exposure to electromagnetic waves and excessive use of mobile phones resulted in disrupted sleep11,12. A cross-sectional study conducted by Demir and Sumer6 in migraine patients in Turkey, demonstrated that mobile phone usage was significantly associated with higher rates of headache, excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality. A similar study to assess the impact of mobile phone usage on sleep in Japanese adolescents found that an increase in use after lights out before sleep was associated with a shorter sleep duration, poorer quality of sleep, insomnia as well as excessive daytime sleepiness13. Similar data are sparse in the Indian population with its distinct genetic and sociocultural characteristics. This study was therefore, conducted to assess the effect of mobile phone usage on the quality and composition of sleep in a representative sample of the Indian population.\n\nMaterial & Methods\n\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2014 to September 2019 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. A total of 566 participants were recruited with the aim to see the effect between the frequency of mobile phone use for calls and short message service (SMS) as well as total duration of mobile phone usage on quality of sleep. Participants were enrolled from the outpatient departments, undergraduate hostels and post-graduate hostels at the AIIMS and PGIMER. All adults in the age group 20 to 60 yr who had used mobile phones for more than one year, were eligible for participation in the study. Those who were suffering from any neurologic or psychiatric illness, critically ill patients, chronic alcoholics and smokers, who had any visual or auditory impairment as well as those with a prior diagnosis of metabolic syndrome were excluded. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee of AIIMS and PGIMER and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.\n\nMeasures:\n\nDemographic data: Age, gender and educational qualifications of all participants were recorded. A basic medical history was taken. Mobile phone use was quantified in terms of total number of calls and SMSs received per day for the past 30 days. If the total number of calls and SMSs per day was ³12 or either of these individually exceeded 11, the participant was considered to be a high user11.\n\nSubjective sleep quality: The subjective sleep quality was assessed with the help of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire14. PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over the preceding one month. It has 19 individual items that generate seven component scores in the following domains-subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (SL), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, need to use medications for sleep and daytime dysfunction. A PSQI global score of ≥5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6 per cent and specificity of 86.5 per cent in distinguishing good and poor sleepers14.\n\nActigraphy: Actigraphy sleep data were collected using the SOMNO watch (Actiwatch Spectrum Plus; Philips Respironics Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA). The monitor provided the estimates of SL, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and the sleep efficiency. SL is defined as the length of time taken to fall asleep - the time between ‘lights off’ to the first period of three minutes of consecutive epochs scored as sleep. WASO refers to the number of minutes awake between sleep onset and time of final waking. Sleep efficiency is defined as the proportion of the estimated sleep periods spent asleep. The data were collected for a period of three days for each participant. The average SL, sleep efficiency and WASO were calculated for period of three days.\n\nPolysomnography (PSG): Polysomnography studies were conducted in the sleep laboratory using Alice 3 or ALICE PDx systems (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA). A continuous polygraphic recording was done from surface electrodes for electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram, thermistors for oral and nasal flow, thoracic and abdominal impedance belts for respiratory efforts, pulse oximetry, tracheal microphone for snoring and sensors for leg and sleep position. PSG records and sleep data were scored as per American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria15. The following sleep parameters were recorded: total sleep time (TST), SL, stage R latency (RL), WASO, time spent in stages N1, N2, N3 and R in per cent of TST and latency from sleep onset to stage N2 and N3.\n\nStatistical analysis: Analysis was done with Stata11.2 (StatCrop LP, College Station; TX, USA). Quantitative variables were presented as mean with standard deviation, median with range and frequency percentage as appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 566 participants were enrolled with recording of demographic variables and administration of PSQI questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 31.03 ± 9.82 yr. The proportion of male participants was 57.60 per cent. 42.4 per cent of the participants had an undergraduate degree. Based on the number of mobile phone calls and messages received each day, 39 per cent of the participants interviewed had a high daily mobile phone usage (Table I).\n\nTable I.\n\nDemographics and mobile phone usage data of participants (n=566)\n\nParameters\tLow usage (n=345)\tHigh usage (n=221)\nAge (yr), mean (SD)*\t32.33 (10.88)\t29 (7.45)\nGender, n (%)##\t\t\nMale\t164 (50.31)\t162 (49.69)\nFemale\t181 (75.42)\t59 (24.58)\nEducational qualification, n (%)***\t\t\nBelow 12th standard\t139 (75.54)\t45 (24.46)\nUndergraduate\t130 (57.52)\t96 (42.48)\nPost-graduate\t76 (48.72)\t80 (51.28)\nOpen in a new tab\n\nP *<0.01, ***<0.001 (Mann-Whitney U test); ##<0.001 (Chi square test).

A higher mobile phone usage was seen to be significantly associated with a poor sleep quality as a component of the PSQI questionnaire (P=0.01) and a higher overall PSQI score (P=0.01) (Figure). A subjectively longer SL period, a shorter total sleep duration, poorer sleep efficiency and evident daytime dysfunction were observed to be associated with excessive cell phone use although these trends did not attain significance (Table II).\n\nFigure.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nHistogram showing the association between mobile phone use in terms frequency of calls and short message services (low vs. high) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score low vs. high\n\nTable II.\n\nPittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score among participants with low and high mobile phone usage\n\nComponent\tResponse\tLow usage (n=345), n (%)\tHigh usage (n=221), n (%)\tP\nSleep quality\tVery good (n=227)\t156 (68.72)\t71 (31.28)\t0.001\n\tFairly good (n=307)\t174 (56.68)\t133 (43.32)\t\n\tFairly bad (n=25)\t12 (48.00)\t13 (52.00)\t\n\tVery bad (n=7)\t3 (42.86)\t4 (57.14)\t\nSleep latency\tNo (n=243)\t158 (65.02)\t85 (34.98)\t0.016\n\tLow (n=227)\t140 (61.67)\t87 (38.33)\t\n\tModerate (n=64)\t32 (50.00)\t32 (50.00)\t\n\tSevere (n=32)\t15 (46.88)\t17 (53.13)\t\nSleep duration (h)\t>7 (n=326)\t208 (63.80)\t118 (36.20)\t0.104\n\t6-7 (n=190)\t109 (57.37)\t81 (42.63)\t\n\t5-6 (n=42)\t24 (57.14)\t18 (42.86)\t\n\t<5 (n=8)\t4 (50.00)\t4 (50.00)\t\nSleep efficiency (%)\t≥85 (n=512)\t319 (62.30)\t193 (37.70)\t0.0348\n\t75-84 (n=35)\t20 (57.14)\t15 (42.86)\t\n\t65-74 (n=13)\t4 (30.77)\t9 (69.23)\t\n\t<65 (n=6)\t2 (33.33)\t4 (66.67)\t\nPSQI\t<5 (n=438)\t280\t158\t0.001\n\t≥5 (n=128)\t65\t63\t\nOpen in a new tab\n\nAn objective assessment of sleep by actigraphy was done for 96 participants (Table III). The median SL for all the participants was 27.5 min (Range: 1-155 min). The median sleep efficiency was seen to be lower in those reporting a low total mobile phone usage as compared to high users [Median (range)=37.5% (0-130.5) vs. 75% (3.5-96.8); P=0.04]. Furthermore, the average SL over three days in users with low usage was higher than in those with a high usage [Median (range)=33.17 min (1-155) vs. 22.71 (1-92); P=0.04]. The average WASO for the period of observation was also seen to be higher among low mobile phone users although the difference was not significant.\n\nTable III.\n\nActigraphy parameters among low and high mobile phone usage (n=96)\n\nParameter\tLow usage\tHigh usage\tP\n\n\t\n\nn\tMedian (range)\tn\tMedian (range)\nWASO day one\t47\t45 (1-211)\t43\t44 (2-430)\t0.93\nWASO day two\t45\t43 (1-300)\t43\t47.5 (2-991)\t0.45\nWASO day three\t36\t42.25 (2-298)\t40\t44.5 (1-208)\t0.79\nOpen in a new tab\n\nMann–Whitney U-test.

However, the latency from sleep onset to N2 and N3 sleep stages were significantly shorter in participants having a higher mobile phone usage as compared to those with a lower usage [Median (range):13.5 min (1.5-109) vs. 6.5 min (0-89); P=0.02] and [Median (range): 49 min (8.5-220.5) vs. 28.75 min (0-141); P=0.03], respectively.\n\nTable IV.\n\nPolysomnography parameters among participants with low and high mobile phone usage (n=95)\n\nParameter\tLow usage\tHigh usage\tP\n\n\t\n\nn\tMedian (range)\tn\tMedian (range)\nTotal sleep time\t46\t352 (148.5-527)\t48\t322.25 (158.5-516)\t0.27\nSleep efficiency\t46\t86.4 (59.9-98)\t49\t86 (45.3-855)\t0.97\nSleep latency\t46\t15 (0-90)\t49\t14 (1-116)\t0.14\nWASO\t46\t35 (5-114.5)\t49\t38.5 (4-182)\t0.38\nN1\t45\t77 (7.5-197)\t43\t54 (8.5-218)\t0.51\nN2\t45\t139.5 (71-238)\t43\t127 (39-236)\t0.61\nN3\t45\t80.5 (15.5-251)\t43\t78 (0-226)\t0.63\nREM\t45\t39 (0-111)\t43\t29 (0-153)\t0.38\nN1%\t45\t19.6 (2.8-58.4)\t43\t21.4 (3.3-84.8)\t0.80\nN2%\t45\t41.4 (20.2-69.9)\t43\t42.2 (10.75)\t0.77\nN3%\t45\t23.6 (4.3-61.8)\t43\t24.10 (0-55.10)\t0.81\nREM%\t45\t10.3 (0-23.6)\t43\t9.9 (0-31.7)\t0.91\nLatency N1 - sleep onset\t39\t0\t33\t0 (0-34.5)\t0.27\nLatency N2 - sleep onset\t39\t13.5 (1.5-109)\t33\t6.5 (0-89)\t0.02\nLatency N3 - sleep onset\t39\t49 (8.5-220.5)\t32\t28.75 (0-141)\t0.03\nLatency REM - sleep onset\t38\t148 (0-400)\t31\t154 (49-343.5)\t0.67\nOpen in a new tab\n\nN, non-rapid eye movement; REM, rapid eye movement; WASO, wake after sleep onset\n\nDiscussion\n\nHigh mobile use is a risk factor for sleep disturbance. Sufficient sleep and recovery is an established predictor of physical and psychological well-being, also among adolescents and young adults16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Sleep disturbances are more prevalent among high mobile phone users due to an increase in SL. Usage of mobile phone at bedtime, significantly increases SL and adversely affects sleep5,23,24. Calls and text messages received during sleeping hours may lead to recurrent night awakenings.\n\nIn this study, subjective sleep quality was evaluated with the help of the PSQI questionnaire wherein a score ³5 was indicative of poor sleep. Our findings were coherent with similar studies in the past where exposure to light and altered melatonin metabolism has been implicated in sleep disturbances caused due to mobile phone usage25. In the current study, quantification of mobile phone use was done only by interviewing the study participants. Several studies have used parameters such as average mobile screen usage time, mobile after the lights have been turned off and using mobile in pre bed time etc26,27.\n\nPrevious studies have found that mobile phone usage, especially near bedtime worsens sleep quality as assessed by PSQI5,24,28,29. Because PSQI relies on the administration of a questionnaire to assess various parameters, it becomes vulnerable to self-reporting bias26 where participants may give biased answers because of their perspective, beliefs and expectations. Because the degree of usage of mobile phones was based on self-reporting, there might have been under-as well as overestimation27,28,29,30 of the effect of usage on the parameters being studied based on factors such as age, sex and educational qualification31,32.\n\nThe actigraphy data showed an increase in sleep efficiency and a decrease in SL in patients with higher mobile phone usage while the average WASO was similar in the two groups. In the PSG subgroup, the sleep efficiency and SL were similar in the two groups. However, the latency to N2 and N3 sleep stages from sleep onset were shorter in the group with higher mobile phone use. These findings appear to be in conflict with the available literature. In a cross-sectional study in 2400 adolescents from 46 schools in Iran, SL was 24±21and 20±18 min in cell phone users and non-users, respectively33, suggesting that cell phone users had significantly higher SL than non-users (P<0.001) similar to our study where higher use for call/SMS was associated with higher sleep latencies.\n\nIn a cross-sectional study based on 9846 adolescents from Norway, 90 per cent of the adolescents reported to use their mobile phone in the hour before going to bed and this was related to self-reported sleep onset latency and sleep deficit34. The PSG subgroup showed that TST was non-significantly associated with mobile phone usage with participants with higher mobile phone usage having a reduction in overall sleep time as assessed by PSG.\n\nSL showed a trend towards being higher in cases with high mobile phone use but the difference fell short of being significant. Similar changes were not observed in the WASO parameter. The increase in sleep efficiency and decrease in SL in high mobile phone users on actigraphy may be explained by the possible bias induced on account of being monitored. While being monitored by actigraphy, the participants likely avoided mobile phone use during sleep. As suggested by poor subjective sleep quality among high mobile phone users, it could be possible that this subgroup was sleep deprived and consequently compensated for sleep loss on the preceding days with an increase in sleep efficiency and a decrease in average latency on actigraphy. It has been reported that the effect of sleep deprivation on PSG is a rebound increase in TST, sleep efficiency and increased percentage of N3 sleep along with a decrease in REM latency and SL from lights off35. In PSG in participants with high mobile phone usage, a decrease was found in latency to N2 and N3 from sleep onset. The clinical significance of the same is not clear; however, this may represent an attempt to consolidate sleep and compensate for poor sleep on preceding days36. One may speculate that a first night effect during in-lab PSG might have nullified any effect of mobile phone use on recorded sleep efficiency and SL37.\n\nOur study had certain limitations. We used number of calls and text messages as a measure of total phone use. In recent times, patterns of mobile phone use have changed with increasing use of social media platforms for messaging. A more objective quantification was not feasible as participants were using different makes of the mobile phones, wherein, usage data were not retrievable from the phones uniformly. Several participants had changed their devices in the previous few weeks or months. In conclusion, our study addresses an important question and paves the way for further studies looking at the relationship between all facets of smart phone usage and their impact on objectively measured sleep quality. Though the observational nature of the study may not fully account for all possible confounding factors in subgroups, but, dose-response between sleep quality and mobile phone use observed in our study supports the hypothesis that mobile phone use may alter sleep habits.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nAuthors acknowledge the support of all staff of Sleep Laboratory of the department of Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi.\n\nFootnotes\n\nFinancial support & sponsorship: This research received grant from Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi.\n\nConflicts of Interest: None.\n\nReferences\n1.Pockett S.

Abstract

This study investigated the effects of smartphone use on the perceived academic performance of elementary school students. Following the derivation of four hypotheses from the literature, descriptive analysis, t testing, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation analysis, and one-way multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) were performed to characterize the relationship between smartphone behavior and academic performance with regard to learning effectiveness. All coefficients were positive and significant, supporting all four hypotheses. We also used structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance. The MANOVA results revealed that the students in the high smartphone use group academically outperformed those in the low smartphone use group. The results indicate that smartphone use constitutes a potential inequality in learning opportunities among elementary school students. Finally, in a discussion of whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance, it is proved that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable impacting academic performance. Fewer smartphone access opportunities may adversely affect learning effectiveness and academic performance. Elementary school teachers must be aware of this issue, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The findings serve as a reference for policymakers and educators on how smartphone use in learning activities affects academic performance.

Introduction

The advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution has stimulated interest in educational reforms for the integration of information and communication technology (ICT) into instruction. Smartphones have become immensely popular ICT devices. In 2019, approximately 96.8% of the global population had access to mobile devices with the coverage rate reaching 100% in various developed countries (Sarker et al., 2019). Given their versatile functions, smartphones have been rapidly integrated into communication and learning, among other domains, and have become an inseparable part of daily life for many. Smartphones are perceived as convenient, easy-to-use tools that promote interaction and multitasking and facilitate both formal and informal learning (Looi et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2016). Studies have investigated the impacts of smartphones in education. For example, Anshari et al. (2017) asserted that the advantages of smartphones in educational contexts include rich content transferability and the facilitation of knowledge sharing and dynamic learning. Modern students expect to experience multiple interactive channels in their studies. These authors also suggested incorporating smartphones into the learning process as a means of addressing inappropriate use of smartphones in class (Anshari et al., 2017). For young children, there are differences in demand and attributes and some need for control depending upon the daily smartphone usage of the children (Cho & Lee, 2017). To avoid negative impacts, including interference with the learning process, teachers should establish appropriate rules and regulations. In a study by Bluestein and Kim (2017) on the use of technology in the classroom they examined three themes: acceptance of tablet technology, learning excitement and engagement, and the effects of teacher preparedness and technological proficiency. They suggested that teachers be trained in application selection and appropriate in-class device usage. Cheng et al. (2016) found that smartphone use facilitated English learning in university students. Some studies have provided empirical evidence of the positive effects of smartphone use, whereas others have questioned the integration of smartphone use into the academic environment. For example, Hawi and Samaha (2016) investigated whether high academic performance was possible for students at high risk of smartphone addiction. They provided strong evidence of the adverse effects of smartphone addiction on academic performance. Lee et al. (2015) found a negative correlation between smartphone addiction and learning in university students. There has been a lot of research on the effectiveness of online teaching, but the results are not consistent. Therefore, this study aims to further explore the effects of independent variables on smartphone use behavior and academic performance.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many countries to close schools and suspend in-person classes, enforcing the transition to online learning. Carrillo and Flores (2020) suggested that because of widespread school closures, teachers must learn to manage the online learning environment. Online courses have distinct impacts on students and their families, requiring adequate technological literacy and the formulation of new teaching or learning strategies (Sepulveda-Escobar & Morrison, 2020). Since 2020, numerous studies have been conducted on parents’ views regarding the relationship of online learning, using smartphones, computers, and other mobile devices, with learning effectiveness. Widely inconsistent findings have been reported. For instance, in a study by Hadad et al. (2020), two thirds of parents were opposed to the use of smartphones in school, with more than half expressing active opposition (n = 220). By contrast, parents in a study by Garbe et al. (2020) agreed to the school closure policy and allowed their children to use smartphones to attend online school. Given the differences in the results, further scholarly discourse on smartphone use in online learning is essential.

Questions remain on whether embracing smartphones in learning systems facilitates or undermines learning (i.e., through distraction). Only a few studies have been conducted on the impacts of smartphone use on academic performance in elementary school students (mostly investigating college or high school students). Thus, we investigated the effects of elementary school students’ smartphone use on their academic performance.

Literature review

Mobile technologies have driven a paradigm shift in learning; learning activities can now be performed anytime, anywhere, as long as the opportunity to obtain information is available (Martin & Ertzberger, 2013).

Kim et al. (2014) focused on identifying factors that influence smartphone adoption or use. Grant and Hsu (2014) centered their investigation on user behavior, examining the role of smartphones as learning devices and social interaction tools. Although the contribution of smartphones to learning is evident, few studies have focused on the connection between smartphones and learning, especially in elementary school students. The relationship between factors related to learning with smartphones among this student population is examined in the following sections.

Behavioral intentions of elementary school students toward smartphone use

Children experience rapid growth and development during elementary school and cultivate various aspects of the human experience, including social skills formed through positive peer interactions. All these experiences exert a substantial impact on the establishment of self-esteem and a positive view of self. Furthermore, students tend to maintain social relationships by interacting with others through various synchronous or asynchronous technologies, including smartphone use (Guo et al., 2011). Moreover, students favor communication through instant messaging, in which responses are delivered rapidly. However, for this type of interaction, students must acquire knowledge and develop skills related to smartphones or related technologies which has an impact on social relationships (Kang & Jung, 2014; Park & Lee, 2012).

Karikoski and Soikkeli (2013) averred that smartphone use promotes human-to-human interaction both through verbal conversation and through the transmission of textual and graphic information, and cn stimulate the creation and reinforcement of social networks. Park and Lee (2012) examined the relationship between smartphone use and motivation, social relationships, and mental health. The found smartphone use to be positively correlated with social intimacy. Regarding evidence supporting smartphone use in learning, Firmansyah et al. (2020) concluded that smartphones significantly benefit student-centered learning, and they can be used in various disciplines and at all stages of education. They also noted the existence of a myriad smartphone applications to fulfill various learning needs. Clayton and Murphy (2016) suggested that smartphones be used as a mainstay in classroom teaching, and that rather than allowing them to distract from learning, educators should help their students to understand how smartphones can aid learning and facilitate civic participation. In other words, when used properly, smartphones have some features that can lead to better educational performance. For example, their mobility can allow students access to the same (internet-based) services as computers, anytime, anywhere (Lepp et al., 2014). Easy accessibility to these functionalities offers students the chance to continuously search for study-related information. Thus, smartphones can provide a multi-media platform to facilitate learning which cannot be replaced by simply reading a textbook (Zhang et al., 2014). Furthermore, social networking sites and communication applications may also contribute to the sharing of relevant information. Faster communication between students and between students and faculty may also contribute to more efficient studying and collaboration (Chen et al., 2015). College students are more likely to have access to smartphones than elementary school students. The surge in smartphone ownership among college students has spurred interest in studying the impact of smartphone use on all aspects of their lives, especially academic performance. For example, Junco and Cotton (2012) found that spending a fair amount of time on smartphones while studying had a negative affect on the university student's Grade Point Average (GPA). In addition, multiple studies have found that mobile phone use is inversely related to academic performance (Judd, 2014; Karpinski et al., 2013). Most research on smartphone use and academic performance has focused on college students. There have few studies focused on elementary school students. Vanderloo (2014) argued that the excessive use of smartphones may cause numerous problems for the growth and development of children, including increased sedentary time and reduced physical activity. Furthermore, according to Sarwar and Soomro (2013), rapid and easy access to information and its transmission may hinder concentration and discourage critical thinking and is therefore not conducive to children’s cognitive development.

To sum up, the evidence on the use of smartphones by elementary school students is conflicting. Some studies have demonstrated that smartphone use can help elementary school students build social relationships and maintain their mental health, and have presented findings supporting elementary students’ use of smartphones in their studies. Others have opposed smartphone use in this student population, contending that it can impede growth and development. To take steps towards resolving this conflict, we investigated smartphone use among elementary school students.

In a study conducted in South Korea, Kim (2017) reported that 50% of their questionnaire respondents reported using smartphones for the first time between grades 4 and 6. Overall, 61.3% of adolescents reported that they had first used smartphones when they were in elementary school. Wang et al. (2017) obtained similar results in an investigation conducted in Taiwan. However, elementary school students are less likely to have access to smartphones than college students. Some elementary schools in Taiwan prohibit their students from using smartphones in the classroom (although they can use them after school). On the basis of these findings, the present study focused on fifth and sixth graders.

Jeong et al. (2016), based on a sample of 944 respondents recruited from 20 elementary schools, found that people who use smartphones for accessing Social Network Services (SNS), playing games, and for entertainment were more likely to be addicted to smartphones. Park (2020) found that games were the most commonly used type of mobile application among participants, comprised of 595 elementary school students. Greater smartphone dependence was associated with greater use of educational applications, videos, and television programs (Park, 2020). Three studies in Taiwan showed the same results, that elementary school students in Taiwan enjoy playing games on smartphones (Wang & Cheng, 2019; Wang et al., 2017). Based on the above, it is reasonable to infer that if elementary school students spend more time playing games on their smartphones, their academic performance will decline. However, several studies have found that using smartphones to help with learning can effectively improve academic performance. In this study we make effort to determine what the key influential factors that affect students' academic performance are.

Kim (2017) reported that, in Korea, smartphones are used most frequentlyfrom 9 pm to 12 am, which closely overlaps the corresponding period in Taiwan, from 8 to 11 pm In this study, we not only asked students how they obtained their smartphones, but when they most frequently used their smartphones, and who they contacted most frequently on their smartphones were, among other questions. There were a total of eight questions addressing smartphone behavior. Recent research on smartphones and academic performance draws on self-reported survey data on hours and/or minutes of daily use (e.g. Chen et al., 2015; Heo & Lee, 2021; Lepp et al., 2014; Troll et al., 2021). Therefore, this study also uses self-reporting to investigate how much time students spend using smartphones.

Various studies have indicated that parental attitudes affect elementary school students’ behavioral intentions toward smartphone use (Chen et al., 2020; Daems et al., 2019). Bae (2015) determined that a democratic parenting style (characterized by warmth, supervision, and rational explanation) was related to a lower likelihood of smartphone addiction in children. Park (2020) suggested that parents should closely monitor their children’s smartphone use patterns and provide consistent discipline to ensure appropriate smartphone use. In a study conducted in Taiwan, Chang et al. (2019) indicated that restrictive parental mediation reduced the risk of smartphone addiction among children. In essence, parental attitudes critically influence the behavioral intention of elementary school students toward smartphone use. The effect of parental control on smartphone use is also investigated in this study.

Another important question related to student smartphone use is self-control. Jeong et al. (2016) found that those who have lower self-control and greater stress were more likely to be addicted to smartphones. Self-control is here defined as the ability to control oneself in the absence of any external force, trying to observe appropriate behavior without seeking immediate gratification and thinking about the future (Lee et al., 2015). Those with greater self-control focus on long-term results when making decisions. People are able to control their behavior through the conscious revision of automatic actions which is an important factor in retaining self-control in the mobile and on-line environments. Self-control plays an important role in smartphone addiction and the prevention thereof. Previous studies have revealed that the lower one’s self-control, the higher the degree of smartphone dependency (Jeong et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013). In other words, those with higher levels of self-control are likely to have lower levels of smartphone addiction. Clearly, self-control is an important factor affecting smartphone usage behavior.

Reviewing the literature related to self-control, we start with self-determination theory (SDT). The SDT (Deci & Ryan, 2008) theory of human motivation distinguishes between autonomous and controlled types of behavior. Ryan and Deci (2000) suggested that some users engage in smartphone communications in response to perceived social pressures, meaning their behavior is externally motivated. However, they may also be intrinsically motivated in the sense that they voluntarily use their smartphones because they feel that mobile communication meets their needs (Reinecke et al., 2017). The most autonomous form of motivation is referred to as intrinsic motivation. Being intrinsically motivated means engaging in an activity for its own sake, because it appears interesting and enjoyable (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Acting due to social pressure represents an externally regulated behavior, which SDT classifies as the most controlled form of motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Individuals engage in such behavior not for the sake of the behavior itself, but to achieve a separable outcome, for example, to avoid punishment or to be accepted and liked by others (Ryan & Deci, 2006). SDT presumes that controlled and autonomous motivations are not complementary, but “work against each other” (Deci et al., 1999, p. 628). According to the theory, external rewards alter the perceived cause of action: Individuals no longer voluntarily engage in an activity because it meets their needs, but because they feel controlled (Deci et al., 1999). For media users, the temptation to communicate through the smartphone is often irresistible (Meier, 2017). Researchers who have examined the reasons why users have difficulty controlling media use have focused on their desire to experience need gratification, which produces pleasurable experiences. The assumption here is that users often subconsciously prefer short-term pleasure gains from media use to the pursuit of long-term goals (Du et al., 2018). Accordingly, self-control is very important. Self-control here refers to the motivation and ability to resist temptations (Hofmann et al., 2009). Dispositional self-control is a key moderator of yielding to temptation (Hofmann et al., 2009). Ryan and Deci (2006) suggested that people sometimes perform externally controlled behaviors unconsciously, that is, without applying self-control.

Sklar et al. (2017) described two types of self-control processes: proactive and reactive. They suggested that deficiencies in the resources needed to inhibit temptation impulses lead to failure of self-control. Even when impossible to avoid a temptation entirely, self-control can still be made easier if one avoids attending to the tempting stimulus. For example, young children instructed to actively avoid paying attention to a gift and other attention-drawing temptations are better able to resist the temptation than children who are just asked to focus on their task. Therefore, this study more closely investigates students' self-control abilities in relation to smartphone use asking the questions, ‘How did you obtain your smartphone?’ (to investigate proactivity), and ‘How much time do you spend on your smartphone in a day?’ (to investigate the effects of self-control).

Thus, the following hypotheses are advanced.

Hypothesis 1: Smartphone behavior varies with parental control.

Hypothesis 2: Smartphone behavior varies based on students' self-control.

Parental control, students' self-control and their effects on learning effectiveness and academic performance

Based on Hypothesis 1 and 2, we believe that we need to focus on two factors, parental control and student self-control and their impact on academic achievement. In East Asia, Confucianism is one of the most prevalent and influential cultural values which affect parent–child relations and parenting practice (Lee et al., 2016). In Taiwan, Confucianism shapes another feature of parenting practice: the strong emphasis on academic achievement. The parents’ zeal for their children’s education is characteristic of Taiwan, even in comparison to academic emphasis in other East Asian countries. Hau and Ho (2010) noted that, in Eastern Asian (Chinese) cultures, academic achievement does not depend on the students’ interests. Chinese students typically do not regard intelligence as fixed, but trainable through learning, which enables them to take a persistent rather than a helpless approach to schoolwork, and subsequently perform well. In Chinese culture, academic achievement has been traditionally regarded as the passport to social success and reputation, and a way to enhance the family's social status (Hau & Ho, 2010). Therefore, parents dedicate a large part of their family resources to their children's education, a practice that is still prevalent in Taiwan today (Hsieh, 2020). Parental control aimed at better academic achievement is exerted within the behavioral and psychological domains. For instance, Taiwan parents tightly schedule and control their children’s time, planning private tutoring after school and on weekends. Parental control thus refers to “parental intrusiveness, pressure, or domination, with the inverse being parental support of autonomy” (Grolnick & Pomerantz, 2009). There are two types of parental control: behavioral and psychological. Behavioral control, which includes parental regulation and monitoring over what children do (Steinberg et al., 1992), predict positive psychosocial outcomes for children. Outcomes include low externalizing problems, high academic achievement (Stice & Barrera, 1995), and low depression. In contrast, psychological control, which is exerted over the children’s psychological world, is known to be problematic (Stolz et al., 2005). Psychological control involves strategies such as guilt induction and love withdrawal (Steinberg et al., 1992) and is related with disregard for children’s emotional autonomy and needs (Steinberg et al., 1992). Therefore, it is very important to discuss the type of parental control.

Troll et al. (2021) suggested that it is not the objective amount of smartphone use but the effective handling of smartphones that helps students with higher trait self-control to fare better academically. Heo and Lee (2021) discussed the mediating effect of self-control. They found that self-control was partially mediated by those who were not at risk for smartphone addiction. That is to say, smartphone addiction could be managed by strengthening self-control to promote healthy use. In an earlier study Hsieh and Lin (2021), we collected 41 international journal papers involving 136,491students across 15 countries, for meta-analysis. We found that the average and majority of the correlations were both negative. The short conclusion here was that smartphone addiction /reliance may have had a negative impact on learning performance. Clearly, it is very important to investigate the effect of self-control on learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance.

Smartphone use and its effects on learning effectiveness and academic performance

The impact of new technologies on learning or academic performance has been investigated in the literature. Kates et al. (2018) conducted a meta-analysis of 39 studies published over a 10-year period (2007–2018) to examine potential relationships between smartphone use and academic achievement. The effect of smartphone use on learning outcomes can be summarized as follows: r =  − 0.16 with a 95% confidence interval of − 0.20 to − 0.13. In other words, smartphone use and academic achievement were negatively correlated. Amez and Beart (2020) systematically reviewed the literature on smartphone use and academic performance, observing the predominance of empirical findings supporting a negative correlation. However, they advised caution in interpreting this result because this negative correlation was less often observed in studies analyzing data collected through paper-and-pencil questionnaires than in studies on data collected through online surveys. Furthermore, this correlation was less often noted in studies in which the analyses were based on self-reported grade point averages than in studies in which actual grades were used. Salvation (2017) revealed that the type of smartphone applications and the method of use determined students’ level of knowledge and overall grades. However, this impact was mediated by the amount of time spent using such applications; that is, when more time is spent on educational smartphone applications, the likelihood of enhancement in knowledge and academic performance is higher. This is because smartphones in this context are used as tools to obtain the information necessary for assignments and tests or examinations. Lin et al. (2021) provided robust evidence that smartphones can promote improvements in academic performance if used appropriately.

In summary, the findings of empirical investigations into the effects of smartphone use have been inconsistent—positive, negative, or none. Thus, we explore the correlation between elementary school students’ smartphone use and learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance through the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 3: Smartphone use is associated with learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance.

Hypothesis 4: Differences in smartphone use correspond to differences in learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance.

Hypotheses 1 to 4 are aimed at understanding the mediating effect of smartphone behavior; see Fig. 1. It is assumed that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable, parental control and self-control are independent variables, and academic performance is the dependent variable. We want to understand the mediation effect of this model.

Model 1: Model to test the impact of parental control and students’ self-control on academic performance

Thus, the following hypotheses are presented.

Hypothesis 5: Smartphone behaviors are the mediating variable to impact the academic performance.

Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on smartphone use for online learning

According to 2020 statistics from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, full or partial school closures have affected approximately 800 million learners worldwide, more than half of the global student population. Schools worldwide have been closed for 14 to 22 weeks on average, equivalent to two thirds of an academic year (UNESCO, 2021). Because of the pandemic, instructors have been compelled to transition to online teaching (Carrillo & Flores, 2020). According to Tang et al. (2020), online learning is among the most effective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effectiveness of online learning for young children is limited by their parents’ technological literacy in terms of their ability to navigate learning platforms and use the relevant resources. Parents’ time availability constitutes another constraint (Dong et al., 2020). Furthermore, a fast and stable Internet connection, as well as access to devices such as desktops, laptops, or tablet computers, definitively affects equity in online education. For example, in 2018, 14% of households in the United States lacked Internet access (Morgan, 2020). In addition, the availability and stability of network connections cannot be guaranteed in relatively remote areas, including some parts of Australia (Park et al., 2021). In Japan, more than 50% of 3-year-old children and 68% of 6-year-old children used the Internet in their studies, but only 21% of households in Thailand have computer equipment (Park et al., 2021).

In short, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in educational practices. With advances in Internet technology and computer hardware, online education has become the norm amid. However, the process and effectiveness of learning in this context is affected by multiple factors. Aside from the parents’ financial ability, knowledge of educational concepts, and technological literacy, the availability of computer equipment and Internet connectivity also exert impacts. This is especially true for elementary school students, who rely on their parents in online learning more than do middle or high school students, because of their short attention spans and undeveloped computer skills. Therefore, this study focuses on the use of smartphones by elementary school students during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on learning effectiveness.

Methods
Participants

Participants were recruited through stratified random sampling. They comprised 499 Taiwanese elementary school students (in grades 5 and 6) who had used smartphones for at least 12 months. Specifically, the students advanced to grades 5 or 6 at the beginning of the 2018–2019 school year. Boys and girls accounted for 47.7% and 52.3% (n = 238 and 261, respectively) of the sample.

Data collection and measurement

In 2020, a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect relevant data. Of the 620 questionnaires distributed, 575 (92.7%) completed questionnaires were returned. After 64 participants were excluded because they had not used their smartphones continually over the past 12 months and 14 participants were excluded for providing invalid responses, 499 individuals remained. The questionnaire was developed by one of the authors on the basis of a literature review. The questionnaire content can be categorized as follows: (1) students’ demographic characteristics, (2) smartphone use, (3) smartphone behavior, and (4) learning effectiveness. The questionnaire was modified according to evaluation feedback provided by six experts. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test the structural validity of the questionnaire. Factor analysis was performed using principal component analysis and oblique rotation. From the exploratory factor analysis, 25 items (15 and 10 items on smartphone behavior and academic performance as constructs, respectively) were extracted and confirmed. According to the results of the exploratory factor analysis, smartphone behavior can be classified into three dimensions: interpersonal communication, leisure and entertainment, and searching for information. Interpersonal communication is defined as when students use smartphones to communicate with classmates or friends, such as in response to questions like ‘I often use my smartphone to call or text my friends’. Leisure and entertainment mean that students spend a lot of their time using their smartphones for leisure and entertainment, e.g. ‘I often use my smartphone to listen to music’ or ‘I often play media games with my smartphone’. Searching for information means that students spend a lot of their time using their smartphones to search for information that will help them learn, such as in response to questions like this ‘I often use my smartphone to search for information online, such as looking up words in a dictionary’ or ‘I will use my smartphone to read e-books and newspapers online’.

Academic performance can be classified into three dimensions: learning activities, learning applications, and learning attitudes. Learning activities are when students use their smartphones to help them with learning, such as in response to a question like ‘I often use some online resources from my smartphone to help with my coursework’. Learning applications are defined as when students apply smartphone software to help them with their learning activities, e.g. ‘With a smartphone, I am more accustomed to using multimedia software’. Learning attitudes define the students’ attitudes toward using the smartphone, with questions like ‘Since I have had a smartphone, I often find class boring; using a smartphone is more fun’ (This is a reverse coded item). The factor analysis results are shown in the appendix (Appendix Tables 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14). It can be seen that the KMO value is higher than 0.75, and the Bartlett’s test is also significant. The total variance explained for smartphone behavior is 53.47% and for academic performance it is 59.81%. These results demonstrate the validity of the research tool.

In this study, students were defined as "proactive" if they had asked their parents to buy a smartphone for their own use and "reactive" if their parents gave them a smartphone unsolicited (i.e. they had not asked for it). According to Heo and Lee (2021), students who proactively asked their parents to buy them a smartphone gave the assurance that they could control themselves and not become addicted, but if they had been given a smartphone (without having to ask for it), they did not need to offer their parents any such guarantees. They defined user addiction (meaning low self-control) as more than four hours of smartphone use per day (Peng et al., 2022).

A cross-tabulation of self-control results is presented in Table 2, with the columns representing “proactive” and “reactive”, and the rows showing “high self-control” and “low self-control”. There are four variables in this cross-tabulation, “Proactive high self-control” (students promised parents they would not become smartphone addicts and were successful), “Proactive low self-control” (assured their parents they would not become smartphone addicts, but were unsuccessful), “Reactive high self-control”, and “Reactive low self-control”.

Regarding internal consistency among the constructs, the Cronbach's α values ranged from 0.850 to 0.884. According to the guidelines established by George and Mallery (2010), these values were acceptable because they exceeded 0.7. The overall Cronbach's α for the constructs was 0.922. The Cronbach's α value of the smartphone behavior construct was 0.850, whereas that of the academic performance construct was 0.884.

Data analysis

The participants’ demographic characteristics and smartphone use (expressed as frequencies and percentages) were subjected to a descriptive analysis. To examine hypotheses 1 and 2, an independent samples t test (for gender and grade) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to test the differences in smartphone use and learning effectiveness with respect to academic performance among elementary school students under various background variables. To test hypothesis 3, Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the association between smartphone behavior and academic performance. To test hypothesis 4, one-way multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was employed to examine differences in smartphone behavior and its impacts on learning effectiveness. To test Hypothesis 5, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance.

Results
Descriptive analysis

The descriptive analysis (Table 1) revealed that the parents of 71.1% of the participants (n = 499) conditionally controlled their smartphone use. Moreover, 42.5% of the participants noted that they started using smartphones in grade 3 or 4. Notably, 43.3% reported that they used their parents’ old smartphones; in other words, almost half of the students used secondhand smartphones. Overall, 79% of the participants indicated that they most frequently used their smartphones after school. Regarding smartphone use on weekends, 54.1% and 44.1% used their smartphones during the daytime and nighttime, respectively. Family members and classmates (45.1% and 43.3%, respectively) were the people that the participants communicated with the most on their smartphones. Regarding bringing their smartphones to school, 53.1% of the participants indicated that they were most concerned about losing their phones. As for smartphone use duration, 28.3% of the participants indicated that they used their smartphones for less than 1 h a day, whereas 24.4% reported using them for 1 to 2 h a day.

Smartphone behavior varies with parental control and based on students' self-control

We used the question ‘How did you obtain your smartphone?’ (to investigate proactivity), and ‘How much time do you spend on your smartphone in a day?’ (to investigate the effects of students' self-control). According to the Hsieh and Lin (2021), and Peng et al. (2022), addition is defined more than 4 h a day are defined as smartphone addiction (meaning that students have low self-control).

Table 2 gives the cross-tabulation results for self-control ability. Students who asked their parents to buy a smartphone, but use it for less than 4 h a day are defined as having ‘Proactive high self-control’; students using a smartphone for more than 4 h a day are defined as having ‘Proactive low self-control’. Students whose parents gave them a smartphone but use them for less than 4 h a day are defined as having ‘Reactive high self-control’; students given smart phones and using them for more than 4 h a day are defined as having ‘Reactive low self-control’; others, we define as having moderate levels of self-control.

Tables 3–5 present the results of the t test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on differences in the smartphone behaviors based on parental control and students' self-control. As mentioned, smartphone behavior can be classified into three dimensions: interpersonal communication, leisure and entertainment, and information searches. Table 3 lists the significant independent variables in the first dimension of smartphone behavior based on parental control and students' self-control. Among the students using their smartphones for the purpose of communication, the proportion of parents enforcing no control over smartphone use was significantly higher than the proportions of parents enforcing strict or conditional control (F = 11.828, p < 0.001). This indicates that the lack of parental control over smartphone use leads to the participants spending more time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication.

For the independent variable of self-control, regardless of whether students had proactive high self-control, proactive low self-control or reactive low self-control, significantly higher levels of interpersonal communication than reactive high self-control were reported (F = 18.88, p < 0.001). This means that students effectively able to control themselves, who had not asked their parents to buy them smartphones, spent less time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication. However, students with high self-control but who had asked their parents to buy them smartphones, would spend more time on interpersonal communication (meaning that while they may not spend a lot of time on their smartphones each day, the time spent on interpersonal communication is no different than for the other groups). Those without effective self-control, regardless of whether they had actively asked their parents to buy them a smartphone or not, would spend more time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication.

Table 4 displays the independent variables (parental control and students' self-control) significant in the dimension of leisure and entertainment. Among the students using their smartphones for this purpose, the proportion of parents enforcing no control over smartphone use was significantly higher than the proportions of parents enforcing strict or conditional control (F = 8.539, p < 0.001). This indicates that the lack of parental control over smartphone use leads to the participants spending more time using their smartphones for leisure and entertainment.

For the independent variable of self-control, students with proactive low self-control and reactive low self-control reported significantly higher use of smartphones for leisure and entertainment than did students with proactive high self-control and reactive high self-control (F = 8.77, p < 0.001). This means that students who cannot control themselves, whether proactive or passive in terms of asking their parents to buy them a smartphone, will spend more time using their smartphones for leisure and entertainment.

Table 5 presents the significant independent variables in the dimension of information searching. Significant differences were observed only for gender, with a significantly higher proportion of girls using their smartphones to search for information (t =  − 3.979, p < 0.001). Parental control and students' self-control had no significance in the dimension of information searching. This means that the parents' attitudes towards control did not affect the students' use of smartphones for information searches. This is conceivable, as Asian parents generally discourage their children from using their smartphones for non-study related activities (such as entertainment or making friends), but not for learning-related activities. It is also worth noting that student self-control was not significant in relation to searching for information. This means that it makes no difference whether or not students have self-control in their search for learning-related information.

Four notable results are presented as follows.

First, a significantly higher proportion of girls used their smartphones to search for information. Second, if smartphone use was not subject to parental control, the participants spent more time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication and for leisure and entertainment rather than for information searches. This means that if parents make the effort to control their children's smartphone use, this will reduce their children's use of smartphones for interpersonal communication and entertainment. Third, student self-control affects smartphone use behavior for interpersonal communication and entertainment (but not searching for information). This does not mean that they spend more time on their smartphones in their daily lives, it means that they spend the most time interacting with people while using their smartphones (For example, they may only spend 2–3 h a day using their smartphone. During those 2–3 h, they spend more than 90% of their time interacting with people and only 10% doing other things), which is the fourth result.

These results support hypotheses 1 and 2.

Pearson’s correlation analysis of smartphone behavior and academic performance

Table 6 presents the results of Pearson’s correlation analysis of smartphone behavior and academic performance. Except for information searches and learning attitudes, all variables exhibited significant and positively correlations. In short, there was a positive correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance. Thus, hypothesis 3 is supported.

Analysis of differences in the academic performance of students with different smartphone behaviors

Differences in smartphone behavior and its impacts on learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance were examined through. In step 1, cluster analysis was conducted to convert continuous variables into discrete variables. In step 2, a one-way MANOVA was performed to analyze differences in the academic performance of students with varying smartphone behavior. Regarding the cluster analysis results (Table 7), the value of the change in the Bayesian information criterion in the second cluster was − 271.954, indicating that it would be appropriate to group the data. Specifically, we assigned the participants into either the high smartphone use group or the low smartphone use group, comprised of 230 and 269 participants (46.1% and 53.9%), respectively.

BIC Bayesian information criterion

The MANOVA was preceded by the Levene test for the equality of variance, which revealed nonsignificant results, F(6, 167,784.219) = 1.285, p > 0.05. Thus, we proceeded to use MANOVA to examine differences in the academic performance of students with differing smartphone behaviors (Table 8). Between-group differences in academic performance were significant, F(3, 495) = 44.083, p < 0.001, Λ = 0.789, η2 = 0.211, power = 0.999. Subsequently, because academic performance consists of three dimensions, we performed univariate tests and an a posteriori comparison.

Table 9 presents the results of the univariate tests. Between-group differences in learning activities were significant, (F[1, 497] = 40.8, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.076, power = 0.999). Between-group differences in learning applications were also significant (F[1, 497] = 117.98, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.192, power = 0.999). Finally, differences between the groups in learning attitudes were significant (F[1, 497] = 23.22, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.045, power = 0.998). The a posteriori comparison demonstrated that the high smartphone use group significantly outperformed the low smartphone use group in all dependent variables with regard to academic performance. Thus, hypothesis 4 is supported.

Smartphone behavior as the mediating variable impacting academic performance

As suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986), smartphone behavior is a mediating variable affecting academic performance. We examined the impact through the following four-step process:

Step 1. The independent variable (parental control and students' self-control) must have a significant effect on the dependent variable (academic performance), as in model 1 (please see Fig. 1).

Step 2. The independent variable (parental control and students' self-control) must have a significant effect on the mediating variable (smartphone behaviors), as in model 2 (please see Fig. 2).

Step 3. When both the independent variable (parental control and student self-control) and the mediator (smartphone behavior) are used as predictors, the mediating variable (smartphone behavior) must have a significant effect on the dependent variable (academic performance), as in model 3 (please see Fig. 3).

Step 4. In model 3, the regression coefficient of the independent variables (parental control and student self-control) on the dependent variables must be less than in mode 1 or become insignificant.

Model 3: Both independent variables (parental control and student self-control) and mediators (smartphone behavior) were used as predictors to predict dependent variables

As can be seen in Fig. 1, parental control and student self-control are observed variables, and smartphone behavior is a latent variable. "Strict" is set to 0, which means "Conditional", with "None" compared to "Strict". “Proactive high self-control” is also set to 0. From Fig. 1 we find that the independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable. The regression coefficient of parental control is 0.176, t = 3.45 (p < 0.01); the regression coefficient of students’ self-control is 0.218, t = 4.12 (p < 0.001), proving the fit of the model (Chi Square = 13.96**, df = 4, GFI = 0.989, AGFI = 0.959, CFI = 0.996, TLI = 0.915, RMSEA = 0.051, SRMR = 0.031). Therefore, the test results for Model 1 are in line with the recommendations of Baron and Kenny (1986).

As can be seen in Fig. 2, the independent variables have a significant effect on smartphone behaviors. The regression coefficient of parental control is 0.166, t = 3.11 (p < 0.01); the regression coefficient of students’ self-control is 0.149, t = 2.85 (p < 0.01). The coefficients of the model fit are: Chi Square = 15.10**, df = 4, GFI = 0.988, AGFI = 0.954, CFI = 0.973, TLI = 0.932, RMSEA = 0.052, SRMR = 0.039. Therefore, the results of the test of Model 2 are in line with the recommendations of Baron and Kenny (1986).

As can be seen in Fig. 3, smartphone behaviors have a significant effect on the dependent variable. The regression coefficient is 0.664, t = 10.2 (p < 0.001). The coefficients of the model fit are: Chi Square = 91.04**, df = 16, GFI = 0.958, AGFI = 0.905, CFI = 0.918, TLI = 0.900, RMSEA = 0.077, SRMR = 0.063. Therefore, the results of the test of Model 3 are in line with the recommendations of Baron and Kenny (1986).

As can be seen in Fig. 4, the regression coefficient of the independent variables (parental control and student self-control) on the dependent variables is less than in model 1, and the parental control variable becomes insignificant. The regression coefficient of parental control is 0.013, t = 0.226 (p > 0.05); the path coefficient of students’ self-control is 0.155, t = 3.07 (p < 0.01).

Model 4: Model three’s regression coefficient of the independent variables (parental control and student self-control) on the dependent variables

To sum up, we prove that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable to impact the academic performance. Thus, hypothesis 5 is supported.

Discussion

This study investigated differences in the smartphone behavior of fifth and sixth graders in Taiwan with different background variables (focus on parental control and students’ self-control) and their effects on academic performance. The correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance was also examined. Although smartphones are being used in elementary school learning activities, relatively few studies have explored their effects on academic performance. In this study, the proportion of girls who used smartphones to search for information was significantly higher than that of boys. Past studies have been inconclusive about gender differences in smartphone use. Lee and Kim (2018) observed no gender differences in smartphone use, but did note that boys engaged in more smartphone use if their parents set fewer restrictions. Kim et al. (2019) found that boys exhibited higher levels of smartphone dependency than girls. By contrast, Kim (2017) reported that girls had higher levels of smartphone dependency than boys did. Most relevant studies have focused on smartphone dependency; comparatively little attention has been devoted to smartphone behavior. The present study contributes to the literature in this regard.

Notably, this study found that parental control affected smartphone use. If the participants’ parents imposed no restrictions, students spent more time on leisure and entertainment and on interpersonal communication rather than on information searches. This is conceivable, as Asian parents generally discourage their children from using their smartphones for non-study related activities (such as entertainment or making friends) but not for learning-related activities. If Asian parents believe that using a smartphone can improve their child's academic performance, they will encourage their child to use it. Parents in Taiwan attach great importance to their children's academic performance (Lee et al., 2016). A considerable amount of research has been conducted on parental attitudes or control in this context. Hwang and Jeong (2015) suggested that parental attitudes mediated their children’s smartphone use. Similarly, Chang et al. (2019) observed that parental attitudes mediated the smartphone use of children in Taiwan. Our results are consistent with extant evidence in this regard. Lee and Ogbolu (2018) demonstrated that the stronger children’s perception was of parental control over their smartphone use, the more frequently they used their smartphones. The study did not further explain the activities the children engaged in on their smartphones after they increased their frequency of use. In the present study, the participants spent more time on their smartphones for leisure and entertainment and for interpersonal communication than for information searches.

Notably, this study also found that students’ self-control affected smartphone use.

Regarding the Pearson’s correlation analysis of smartphone behavior and academic performance, except for information searches and learning attitudes, all the variables were significantly positively correlated. In other words, there was a positive correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance. In their systematic review, Amez and Beart (2020) determined that most empirical results provided evidence of a negative correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance, playing a more considerable role in that relationship than the theoretical mechanisms or empirical methods in the studies they examined. The discrepancy between our results and theirs can be explained by the between-study variations in the definitions of learning achievement or performance.

Regarding the present results on the differences in the academic performance of students with varying smartphone behaviors, we carried out a cluster analysis, dividing the participants into a high smartphone use group and a low smartphone use group. Subsequent MANOVA revealed that the high smartphone use group academically outperformed the low smartphone use group; significant differences were noted in the academic performance of students with different smartphone behaviors. Given the observed correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance, this result is not unexpected. The findings on the relationship between smartphone behavior and academic performance can be applied to smartphone use in the context of education.

Finally, in a discussion of whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance, it is proved that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable impacting academic performance. Our findings show that parental control and students’ self-control can affect academic performance. However, the role of the mediating variable (smartphone use behavior) means that changes in parental control have no effect on academic achievement at all. This means that smartphone use behaviors have a full mediating effect on parental control. It is also found that students’ self-control has a partial mediating effect. Our findings suggest that parental attitudes towards the control of smartphone use and students' self-control do affect academic performance, but smartphone use behavior has a significant mediating effect on this. In other words, it is more important to understand the children's smartphone behavior than to control their smartphone usage. There have been many studies in the past exploring the mediator variables for smartphone use addiction and academic performance. For instance, Ahmed et al. (2020) found that the mediating variables of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and attitude have a significant and positive influence in the relationship between smartphone functions. Cho and Lee (2017) found that parental attitude is the mediating variable for smartphone use addiction. Cho et al. (2017) indicated that stress had a significant influence on smartphone addiction, while self-control mediates that influence. In conclusion, the outcomes demonstrate that parental control and students’ self-control do influence student academic performance in primary school. Previous studies have offered mixed results as to whether smartphone usage has an adverse or affirmative influence on student academic performance. This study points out a new direction, thinking of smartphone use behavior as a mediator.

In brief, the participants spent more smartphone time on leisure and entertainment and interpersonal communication, but the academic performance of the high smartphone use group surpassed that of the low smartphone use group. This result may clarify the role of students’ communication skills in their smartphone use. As Kang and Jung (2014) noted, conventional communication methods have been largely replaced by mobile technologies. This suggests that students’ conventional communication skills are also shifting to accommodate smartphone use. Elementary students are relatively confident in communicating with others through smartphones; thus, they likely have greater self‐efficacy in this regard and in turn may be better able to improve their academic performance by leveraging mobile technologies. This premise requires verification through further research. Notably, high smartphone use suggests the greater availability of time and opportunity in this regard. Conversely, low smartphone use suggests the relative lack of such time and opportunity. The finding that the high smartphone use group academically outperformed the low smartphone use group also indicates that smartphone accessibility constitutes a potential inequality in the learning opportunities of elementary school students. Therefore, elementary school teachers must be aware of this issue, especially in view of the shift to online learning triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, when many students are dependent on smartphones and computers for online learning.

Conclusions and implications

This study examined the relationship between smartphone behavior and academic performance for fifth and sixth graders in Taiwan. Various background variables (parental control and students’ self-control) were also considered. The findings provide new insights into student attitudes toward smartphone use and into the impacts of smartphone use on academic performance. Smartphone behavior and academic performance were correlated. The students in the high smartphone use group academically outperformed the low smartphone use group. This result indicates that smartphone use constitutes a potential inequality in elementary school students’ learning opportunities. This can be explained as follows: high smartphone use suggests that the participants had sufficient time and opportunity to access and use smartphones. Conversely, low smartphone use suggests that the participants did not have sufficient time and opportunity for this purpose. Students’ academic performance may be adversely affected by fewer opportunities for access. Disparities between their performance and that of their peers with ready access to smartphones may widen amid the prevalent class suspension and school closure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

This study has laid down the basic foundations for future studies concerning the influence of smartphones on student academic performance in primary school as the outcome variable. This model can be replicated and applied to other social science variables which can influence the academic performance of primary school students as the outcome variable. Moreover, the outcomes of this study can also provide guidelines to teachers, parents, and policymakers on how smartphones can be most effectively used to derive the maximum benefits in relation to academic performance in primary school as the outcome variable. Finally, the discussion of the mediating variable can also be used as the basis for the future projects.

Limitations and areas of future research

This research is significant in the field of smartphone functions and the student academic performance for primary school students. However, certain limitations remain. The small number of students sampled is the main problem in this study. For more generalized results, the sample data may be taken across countries within the region and increased in number (rather than limited to certain cities and countries). For more robust results, data might also be obtained from both rural and urban centers. In this study, only one mediating variable was incorporated, but in future studies, several other psychological and behavioral variables might be included for more comprehensive outcomes. We used the SEM-based multivariate approach which does not address the cause and effect between the variables, therefore, in future work, more robust models could be employed for cause-and-effect investigation amongst the variables.

Following the derivation of four hypotheses from the literature, descriptive analysis, t testing, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation analysis, and one-way multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) were performed to characterize the relationship between smartphone behavior and academic performance with regard to learning effectiveness. All coefficients were positive and significant, supporting all four hypotheses. We also used structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance. The MANOVA results revealed that the students in the high smartphone use group academically outperformed those in the low smartphone use group. The results indicate that smartphone use constitutes a potential inequality in learning opportunities among elementary school students. Finally, in a discussion of whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance, it is proved that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable impacting academic performance. Fewer smartphone access opportunities may adversely affect learning effectiveness and academic performance. Elementary school teachers must be aware of this issue, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The findings serve as a reference for policymakers and educators on how smartphone use in learning activities affects academic performance.\n\nKeywords: Smartphone use, Learning effectiveness, Human–computer interface, Media in education, Elementary education\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution has stimulated interest in educational reforms for the integration of information and communication technology (ICT) into instruction. Smartphones have become immensely popular ICT devices. In 2019, approximately 96.8% of the global population had access to mobile devices with the coverage rate reaching 100% in various developed countries (Sarker et al., 2019). Given their versatile functions, smartphones have been rapidly integrated into communication and learning, among other domains, and have become an inseparable part of daily life for many. Smartphones are perceived as convenient, easy-to-use tools that promote interaction and multitasking and facilitate both formal and informal learning (Looi et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2016). Studies have investigated the impacts of smartphones in education. For example, Anshari et al. (2017) asserted that the advantages of smartphones in educational contexts include rich content transferability and the facilitation of knowledge sharing and dynamic learning. Modern students expect to experience multiple interactive channels in their studies. These authors also suggested incorporating smartphones into the learning process as a means of addressing inappropriate use of smartphones in class (Anshari et al., 2017). For young children, there are differences in demand and attributes and some need for control depending upon the daily smartphone usage of the children (Cho & Lee, 2017). To avoid negative impacts, including interference with the learning process, teachers should establish appropriate rules and regulations. In a study by Bluestein and Kim (2017) on the use of technology in the classroom they examined three themes: acceptance of tablet technology, learning excitement and engagement, and the effects of teacher preparedness and technological proficiency. They suggested that teachers be trained in application selection and appropriate in-class device usage. Cheng et al. (2016) found that smartphone use facilitated English learning in university students. Some studies have provided empirical evidence of the positive effects of smartphone use, whereas others have questioned the integration of smartphone use into the academic environment. For example, Hawi and Samaha (2016) investigated whether high academic performance was possible for students at high risk of smartphone addiction. They provided strong evidence of the adverse effects of smartphone addiction on academic performance. Lee et al. (2015) found a negative correlation between smartphone addiction and learning in university students. There has been a lot of research on the effectiveness of online teaching, but the results are not consistent. Therefore, this study aims to further explore the effects of independent variables on smartphone use behavior and academic performance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused many countries to close schools and suspend in-person classes, enforcing the transition to online learning. Carrillo and Flores (2020) suggested that because of widespread school closures, teachers must learn to manage the online learning environment. Online courses have distinct impacts on students and their families, requiring adequate technological literacy and the formulation of new teaching or learning strategies (Sepulveda-Escobar & Morrison, 2020). Since 2020, numerous studies have been conducted on parents’ views regarding the relationship of online learning, using smartphones, computers, and other mobile devices, with learning effectiveness. Widely inconsistent findings have been reported. For instance, in a study by Hadad et al. (2020), two thirds of parents were opposed to the use of smartphones in school, with more than half expressing active opposition (n\u2009=\u2009220). By contrast, parents in a study by Garbe et al. (2020) agreed to the school closure policy and allowed their children to use smartphones to attend online school. Given the differences in the results, further scholarly discourse on smartphone use in online learning is essential.\n\nQuestions remain on whether embracing smartphones in learning systems facilitates or undermines learning (i.e., through distraction). Only a few studies have been conducted on the impacts of smartphone use on academic performance in elementary school students (mostly investigating college or high school students). Thus, we investigated the effects of elementary school students’ smartphone use on their academic performance.\n\nLiterature review\n\nMobile technologies have driven a paradigm shift in learning; learning activities can now be performed anytime, anywhere, as long as the opportunity to obtain information is available (Martin & Ertzberger, 2013).\n\nKim et al. (2014) focused on identifying factors that influence smartphone adoption or use. Grant and Hsu (2014) centered their investigation on user behavior, examining the role of smartphones as learning devices and social interaction tools. Although the contribution of smartphones to learning is evident, few studies have focused on the connection between smartphones and learning, especially in elementary school students. The relationship between factors related to learning with smartphones among this student population is examined in the following sections.\n\nBehavioral intentions of elementary school students toward smartphone use\n\nChildren experience rapid growth and development during elementary school and cultivate various aspects of the human experience, including social skills formed through positive peer interactions. All these experiences exert a substantial impact on the establishment of self-esteem and a positive view of self. Furthermore, students tend to maintain social relationships by interacting with others through various synchronous or asynchronous technologies, including smartphone use (Guo et al., 2011). Moreover, students favor communication through instant messaging, in which responses are delivered rapidly. However, for this type of interaction, students must acquire knowledge and develop skills related to smartphones or related technologies which has an impact on social relationships (Kang & Jung, 2014; Park & Lee, 2012).\n\nKarikoski and Soikkeli (2013) averred that smartphone use promotes human-to-human interaction both through verbal conversation and through the transmission of textual and graphic information, and cn stimulate the creation and reinforcement of social networks. Park and Lee (2012) examined the relationship between smartphone use and motivation, social relationships, and mental health. The found smartphone use to be positively correlated with social intimacy. Regarding evidence supporting smartphone use in learning, Firmansyah et al. (2020) concluded that smartphones significantly benefit student-centered learning, and they can be used in various disciplines and at all stages of education. They also noted the existence of a myriad smartphone applications to fulfill various learning needs. Clayton and Murphy (2016) suggested that smartphones be used as a mainstay in classroom teaching, and that rather than allowing them to distract from learning, educators should help their students to understand how smartphones can aid learning and facilitate civic participation. In other words, when used properly, smartphones have some features that can lead to better educational performance. For example, their mobility can allow students access to the same (internet-based) services as computers, anytime, anywhere (Lepp et al., 2014). Easy accessibility to these functionalities offers students the chance to continuously search for study-related information. Thus, smartphones can provide a multi-media platform to facilitate learning which cannot be replaced by simply reading a textbook (Zhang et al., 2014). Furthermore, social networking sites and communication applications may also contribute to the sharing of relevant information. Faster communication between students and between students and faculty may also contribute to more efficient studying and collaboration (Chen et al., 2015). College students are more likely to have access to smartphones than elementary school students. The surge in smartphone ownership among college students has spurred interest in studying the impact of smartphone use on all aspects of their lives, especially academic performance. For example, Junco and Cotton (2012) found that spending a fair amount of time on smartphones while studying had a negative affect on the university student\'s Grade Point Average (GPA). In addition, multiple studies have found that mobile phone use is inversely related to academic performance (Judd, 2014; Karpinski et al., 2013). Most research on smartphone use and academic performance has focused on college students. There have few studies focused on elementary school students. Vanderloo (2014) argued that the excessive use of smartphones may cause numerous problems for the growth and development of children, including increased sedentary time and reduced physical activity. Furthermore, according to Sarwar and Soomro (2013), rapid and easy access to information and its transmission may hinder concentration and discourage critical thinking and is therefore not conducive to children’s cognitive development.\n\nTo sum up, the evidence on the use of smartphones by elementary school students is conflicting. Some studies have demonstrated that smartphone use can help elementary school students build social relationships and maintain their mental health, and have presented findings supporting elementary students’ use of smartphones in their studies. Others have opposed smartphone use in this student population, contending that it can impede growth and development. To take steps towards resolving this conflict, we investigated smartphone use among elementary school students.\n\nIn a study conducted in South Korea, Kim (2017) reported that 50% of their questionnaire respondents reported using smartphones for the first time between grades 4 and 6. Overall, 61.3% of adolescents reported that they had first used smartphones when they were in elementary school. Wang et al. (2017) obtained similar results in an investigation conducted in Taiwan. However, elementary school students are less likely to have access to smartphones than college students. Some elementary schools in Taiwan prohibit their students from using smartphones in the classroom (although they can use them after school). On the basis of these findings, the present study focused on fifth and sixth graders.\n\nJeong et al. (2016), based on a sample of 944 respondents recruited from 20 elementary schools, found that people who use smartphones for accessing Social Network Services (SNS), playing games, and for entertainment were more likely to be addicted to smartphones. Park (2020) found that games were the most commonly used type of mobile application among participants, comprised of 595 elementary school students. Greater smartphone dependence was associated with greater use of educational applications, videos, and television programs (Park, 2020). Three studies in Taiwan showed the same results, that elementary school students in Taiwan enjoy playing games on smartphones (Wang & Cheng, 2019; Wang et al., 2017). Based on the above, it is reasonable to infer that if elementary school students spend more time playing games on their smartphones, their academic performance will decline. However, several studies have found that using smartphones to help with learning can effectively improve academic performance. In this study we make effort to determine what the key influential factors that affect students\' academic performance are.\n\nKim (2017) reported that, in Korea, smartphones are used most frequentlyfrom 9\xa0pm to 12 am, which closely overlaps the corresponding period in Taiwan, from 8 to 11\xa0pm In this study, we not only asked students how they obtained their smartphones, but when they most frequently used their smartphones, and who they contacted most frequently on their smartphones were, among other questions. There were a total of eight questions addressing smartphone behavior. Recent research on smartphones and academic performance draws on self-reported survey data on hours and/or minutes of daily use (e.g. Chen et al., 2015; Heo & Lee, 2021; Lepp et al., 2014; Troll et al., 2021). Therefore, this study also uses self-reporting to investigate how much time students spend using smartphones.\n\nVarious studies have indicated that parental attitudes affect elementary school students’ behavioral intentions toward smartphone use (Chen et al., 2020; Daems et al., 2019). Bae (2015) determined that a democratic parenting style (characterized by warmth, supervision, and rational explanation) was related to a lower likelihood of smartphone addiction in children. Park (2020) suggested that parents should closely monitor their children’s smartphone use patterns and provide consistent discipline to ensure appropriate smartphone use. In a study conducted in Taiwan, Chang et al. (2019) indicated that restrictive parental mediation reduced the risk of smartphone addiction among children. In essence, parental attitudes critically influence the behavioral intention of elementary school students toward smartphone use. The effect of parental control on smartphone use is also investigated in this study.\n\nAnother important question related to student smartphone use is self-control. Jeong et al. (2016) found that those who have lower self-control and greater stress were more likely to be addicted to smartphones. Self-control is here defined as the ability to control oneself in the absence of any external force, trying to observe appropriate behavior without seeking immediate gratification and thinking about the future (Lee et al., 2015). Those with greater self-control focus on long-term results when making decisions. People are able to control their behavior through the conscious revision of automatic actions which is an important factor in retaining self-control in the mobile and on-line environments. Self-control plays an important role in smartphone addiction and the prevention thereof. Previous studies have revealed that the lower one’s self-control, the higher the degree of smartphone dependency (Jeong et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013). In other words, those with higher levels of self-control are likely to have lower levels of smartphone addiction. Clearly, self-control is an important factor affecting smartphone usage behavior.\n\nReviewing the literature related to self-control, we start with self-determination theory (SDT). The SDT (Deci & Ryan, 2008) theory of human motivation distinguishes between autonomous and controlled types of behavior. Ryan and Deci (2000) suggested that some users engage in smartphone communications in response to perceived social pressures, meaning their behavior is externally motivated. However, they may also be\xa0intrinsically\xa0motivated in the sense that they voluntarily use their smartphones because they feel that mobile communication meets their needs (Reinecke et al., 2017). The most autonomous form of motivation is referred to as intrinsic motivation. Being intrinsically motivated means engaging in an activity for its own sake, because it appears interesting and enjoyable (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Acting due to social pressure represents an externally regulated behavior, which SDT classifies as the most controlled form of motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Individuals engage in such behavior not for the sake of the behavior itself, but to achieve a separable outcome, for example, to avoid punishment or to be accepted and liked by others (Ryan & Deci, 2006). SDT presumes that controlled and autonomous motivations are not complementary, but “work against each other” (Deci et al., 1999, p. 628). According to the theory, external rewards alter the perceived cause of action: Individuals no longer voluntarily engage in an activity because it meets their needs, but because they feel controlled (Deci et al., 1999). For media users, the temptation to communicate through the smartphone is often irresistible (Meier, 2017). Researchers who have examined the reasons why users have difficulty controlling media use have focused on their desire to experience need gratification, which produces pleasurable experiences. The assumption here is that users often subconsciously prefer short-term pleasure gains from media use to the pursuit of long-term goals (Du et al., 2018). Accordingly, self-control is very important. Self-control here refers to the motivation and ability to resist temptations (Hofmann et al., 2009). Dispositional self-control is a key moderator of yielding to temptation (Hofmann et al., 2009). Ryan and Deci (2006) suggested that people sometimes perform externally controlled behaviors unconsciously, that is, without applying self-control.\n\nSklar et al. (2017) described two types of self-control processes: proactive and reactive. They suggested that deficiencies in the resources needed to inhibit temptation impulses lead to failure of self-control. Even when impossible to avoid a temptation entirely, self-control can still be made easier if one avoids attending to the tempting stimulus. For example, young children instructed to actively avoid paying attention to a gift and other attention-drawing temptations are better able to resist the temptation than children who are just asked to focus on their task. Therefore, this study more closely investigates students\' self-control abilities in relation to smartphone use asking the questions, ‘How did you obtain your smartphone?’ (to investigate proactivity), and ‘How much time do you spend on your smartphone in a day?’ (to investigate the effects of self-control).\n\nThus, the following hypotheses are advanced.\n\nHypothesis 1: Smartphone behavior varies with parental control.\n\nHypothesis 2: Smartphone behavior varies based on students\' self-control.\n\nParental control, students\' self-control and their effects on learning effectiveness and academic performance\n\nBased on Hypothesis 1 and 2, we believe that we need to focus on two factors, parental control and student self-control and their impact on academic achievement. In East Asia, Confucianism is one of the most prevalent and influential cultural values which affect parent–child relations and parenting practice (Lee et al., 2016). In Taiwan, Confucianism shapes another feature of parenting practice: the strong emphasis on academic achievement. The parents’ zeal for their children’s education is characteristic of Taiwan, even in comparison to academic emphasis in other East Asian countries. Hau and Ho (2010) noted that, in Eastern Asian (Chinese) cultures, academic achievement does not depend on the students’ interests. Chinese students typically do not regard intelligence as fixed, but trainable through learning, which enables them to take a persistent rather than a helpless approach to schoolwork, and subsequently perform well. In Chinese culture, academic achievement has been traditionally regarded as the passport to social success and reputation, and a way to enhance the family\'s social status (Hau & Ho, 2010). Therefore, parents dedicate a large part of their family resources to their children\'s education, a practice that is still prevalent in Taiwan today (Hsieh, 2020). Parental control aimed at better academic achievement is exerted within the behavioral and psychological domains. For instance, Taiwan parents tightly schedule and control their children’s time, planning private tutoring after school and on weekends. Parental control thus refers to “parental intrusiveness, pressure, or domination, with the inverse being parental support of autonomy” (Grolnick & Pomerantz, 2009). There are two types of parental control: behavioral and psychological. Behavioral control, which includes parental regulation and monitoring over what children do (Steinberg et al., 1992), predict positive psychosocial outcomes for children. Outcomes include low externalizing problems, high academic achievement (Stice & Barrera, 1995), and low depression. In contrast, psychological control, which is exerted over the children’s psychological world, is known to be problematic\xa0(Stolz et al., 2005). Psychological control involves strategies such as guilt induction and love withdrawal (Steinberg et al., 1992) and is related with disregard for children’s emotional autonomy and needs (Steinberg et al., 1992). Therefore, it is very important to discuss the type of parental control.\n\nTroll et al. (2021) suggested that it is not the objective amount of smartphone use but the effective handling of smartphones that helps students with higher trait self-control to fare better academically. Heo and Lee (2021) discussed the mediating effect of self-control. They found that self-control was partially mediated by those who were not at risk for smartphone addiction. That is to say, smartphone addiction could be managed by strengthening self-control to promote healthy use. In an earlier study Hsieh and Lin (2021), we collected 41 international journal papers involving 136,491students across 15 countries, for meta-analysis. We found that the average and majority of the correlations were both negative. The short conclusion here was that smartphone addiction /reliance\xa0may have had a negative impact\xa0on learning performance. Clearly, it is very important to investigate the effect of self-control on learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance.\n\nSmartphone use and its effects on learning effectiveness and academic performance\n\nThe impact of new technologies on learning or academic performance has been investigated in the literature. Kates et al. (2018) conducted a meta-analysis of 39 studies published over a 10-year period (2007–2018) to examine potential relationships between smartphone use and academic achievement. The effect of smartphone use on learning outcomes can be summarized as follows: r\u2009=\u2009\u2009−\u20090.16 with a 95% confidence interval of\u2009−\u20090.20 to\u2009−\u20090.13. In other words, smartphone use and academic achievement were negatively correlated. Amez and Beart (2020) systematically reviewed the literature on smartphone use and academic performance, observing the predominance of empirical findings supporting a negative correlation. However, they advised caution in interpreting this result because this negative correlation was less often observed in studies analyzing data collected through paper-and-pencil questionnaires than in studies on data collected through online surveys. Furthermore, this correlation was less often noted in studies in which the analyses were based on self-reported grade point averages than in studies in which actual grades were used. Salvation (2017) revealed that the type of smartphone applications and the method of use determined students’ level of knowledge and overall grades. However, this impact was mediated by the amount of time spent using such applications; that is, when more time is spent on educational smartphone applications, the likelihood of enhancement in knowledge and academic performance is higher. This is because smartphones in this context are used as tools to obtain the information necessary for assignments and tests or examinations. Lin et al. (2021) provided robust evidence that smartphones can promote improvements in academic performance if used appropriately.\n\nIn summary, the findings of empirical investigations into the effects of smartphone use have been inconsistent—positive, negative, or none. Thus, we explore the correlation between elementary school students’ smartphone use and learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance through the following hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 3: Smartphone use is associated with learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance.\n\nHypothesis 4: Differences in smartphone use correspond to differences in learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance.\n\nHypotheses 1 to 4 are aimed at understanding the mediating effect of smartphone behavior; see Fig.\xa01. It is assumed that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable, parental control and self-control are independent variables, and academic performance is the dependent variable. We want to understand the mediation effect of this model.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nModel 1: Model to test the impact of parental control and students’ self-control on academic performance\n\nThus, the following hypotheses are presented.\n\nHypothesis 5: Smartphone behaviors are the mediating variable to impact the academic performance.\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on smartphone use for online learning\n\nAccording to 2020 statistics from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, full or partial school closures have affected approximately 800 million learners worldwide, more than half of the global student population. Schools worldwide have been closed for 14 to 22\xa0weeks on average, equivalent to two thirds of an academic year (UNESCO, 2021). Because of the pandemic, instructors have been compelled to transition to online teaching (Carrillo & Flores, 2020). According to Tang et al. (2020), online learning is among the most effective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effectiveness of online learning for young children is limited by their parents’ technological literacy in terms of their ability to navigate learning platforms and use the relevant resources. Parents’ time availability constitutes another constraint (Dong et al., 2020). Furthermore, a fast and stable Internet connection, as well as access to devices such as desktops, laptops, or tablet computers, definitively affects equity in online education. For example, in 2018, 14% of households in the United States lacked Internet access (Morgan, 2020). In addition, the availability and stability of network connections cannot be guaranteed in relatively remote areas, including some parts of Australia (Park et al., 2021). In Japan, more than 50% of 3-year-old children and 68% of 6-year-old children used the Internet in their studies, but only 21% of households in Thailand have computer equipment (Park et al., 2021).\n\nIn short, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in educational practices. With advances in Internet technology and computer hardware, online education has become the norm amid. However, the process and effectiveness of learning in this context is affected by multiple factors. Aside from the parents’ financial ability, knowledge of educational concepts, and technological literacy, the availability of computer equipment and Internet connectivity also exert impacts. This is especially true for elementary school students, who rely on their parents in online learning more than do middle or high school students, because of their short attention spans and undeveloped computer skills. Therefore, this study focuses on the use of smartphones by elementary school students during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on learning effectiveness.\n\nMethods\nParticipants\n\nParticipants were recruited through stratified random sampling. They comprised 499 Taiwanese elementary school students (in grades 5 and 6) who had used smartphones for at least 12\xa0months. Specifically, the students advanced to grades 5 or 6 at the beginning of the 2018–2019 school year. Boys and girls accounted for 47.7% and 52.3% (n\u2009=\u2009238 and 261, respectively) of the sample.\n\nData collection and measurement\n\nIn 2020, a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect relevant data. Of the 620 questionnaires distributed, 575 (92.7%) completed questionnaires were returned. After 64 participants were excluded because they had not used their smartphones continually over the past 12\xa0months and 14 participants were excluded for providing invalid responses, 499 individuals remained. The questionnaire was developed by one of the authors on the basis of a literature review. The questionnaire content can be categorized as follows: (1) students’ demographic characteristics, (2) smartphone use, (3) smartphone behavior, and (4) learning effectiveness. The questionnaire was modified according to evaluation feedback provided by six experts. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test the structural validity of the questionnaire. Factor analysis was performed using principal component analysis and oblique rotation. From the exploratory factor analysis, 25 items (15 and 10 items on smartphone behavior and academic performance as constructs, respectively) were extracted and confirmed. According to the results of the exploratory factor analysis, smartphone behavior can be classified into three dimensions: interpersonal communication, leisure and entertainment, and searching for information. Interpersonal communication is defined as when students use smartphones to communicate with classmates or friends, such as in response to questions like ‘I often use my smartphone to call or text my friends’. Leisure and entertainment mean that students spend a lot of their time using their smartphones for leisure and entertainment, e.g. ‘I often use my smartphone to listen to music’ or ‘I often play media games with my smartphone’. Searching for information means that students spend a lot of their time using their smartphones to search for information that will help them learn, such as in response to questions like this ‘I often use my smartphone to search for information online, such as looking up words in a dictionary’ or ‘I will use my smartphone to read e-books and newspapers online’.\n\nAcademic performance can be classified into three dimensions: learning activities, learning applications, and learning attitudes. Learning activities are when students use their smartphones to help them with learning, such as in response to a question like ‘I often use some online resources from my smartphone to help with my coursework’. Learning applications are defined as when students apply smartphone software to help them with their learning activities, e.g. ‘With a smartphone, I am more accustomed to using multimedia software’. Learning attitudes define the students’ attitudes toward using the smartphone, with questions like ‘Since I have had a smartphone, I often find class boring; using a smartphone is more fun’ (This is a reverse coded item). The factor analysis results are shown in the appendix (Appendix Tables 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14). It can be seen that the KMO value is higher than 0.75, and the Bartlett’s test is also significant. The total variance explained for smartphone behavior is 53.47% and for academic performance it is 59.81%. These results demonstrate the validity of the research tool.\n\nTable 10.\n\nKMO and Bartlett\'s Test\n\nConstruct name\tKMO\tBartlett\'s Test of Sphericity\tdf\tp Value\nSmartphone behavior\t.846\t2198.32***\t105\t\u2009<\u2009.001\nAcademic performance\t.731\t1128.61***\t45\t\u2009<\u2009.001\nOpen in a new tab\nTable 11.\n\nTotal variance explained of smartphone behavior\n\nConstruct name\tTotal Variance Explained\t\nEigenvalues\t% of Variance\tCumulative %\nInterpersonal communication\t4.40\t29.33\t29.33\nLeisure and entertainment\t2.27\t15.13\t44.47\nInformation searches\t1.35\t9.00\t53.47\nOpen in a new tab\nTable 12.\n\nTotal variance explained of academic performance\n\nConstruct name\tTotal Variance Explained\nEigenvalues\t% of Variance\tCumulative %\nLearning activities\t2.93\t29.30\t29.30\nLearning applications\t2.94\t19.41\t47.71\nLearning attitudes\t1.11\t11.09\t59.81\nOpen in a new tab\nTable 13.\n\nFactor loading of smartphone behavior\n\nItem No\tCommunalities\tfactor\t\n1\t2\t3\n1\t.466\t.695\t\t\n2\t.527\t.739\t\t\n3\t.357\t.561\t\t\n4\t.631\t.693\t\t\n5\t.504\t.666\t\t\n6\t.718\t.513\t\t\n7\t.490\t\t\t610\n8\t.540\t\t\t.601\n9\t.383\t\t\t.618\n10\t.358\t\t\t.522\n11\t.557\t\t.766\t\n12\t.512\t\t.768\t\n13\t.740\t\t.805\t\n14\t.671\t\t.792\t\n15\t.568\t\t.748\t\nOpen in a new tab\nTable 14.\n\nFactor loading of academic performance\n\nItem No\tCommunalities\tfactor\t\n1\t2\t3\n1\t.568\t\t\t.522\n2\t.651\t\t\t.731\n3\t.491\t\t\t.575\n4\t.675\t.842\t\t\n5\t.726\t.873\t\t\n6\t.535\t.663\t\t\n7\t.585\t\t.588\t\n8\t.653\t\t.730\t\n9\t.505\t\t.832\t\nOpen in a new tab\n\nIn this study, students were defined as "proactive" if they had asked their parents to buy a smartphone for their own use and "reactive" if their parents gave them a smartphone unsolicited (i.e. they had not asked for it). According to Heo and Lee (2021), students who proactively asked their parents to buy them a smartphone gave the assurance that they could control themselves and not become addicted, but if they had been given a smartphone (without having to ask for it), they did not need to offer their parents any such guarantees. They defined user addiction (meaning low self-control) as more than four hours of smartphone use per day (Peng et al., 2022).\n\nA cross-tabulation of self-control results is presented in Table 2, with the columns representing “proactive” and “reactive”, and the rows showing “high self-control” and “low self-control”. There are four variables in this cross-tabulation, “Proactive high self-control” (students promised parents they would not become smartphone addicts and were successful), “Proactive low self-control” (assured their parents they would not become smartphone addicts, but were unsuccessful), “Reactive high self-control”, and “Reactive low self-control”.\n\nTable 2.\n\nCross-tabulation of self-control ability\n\n\tStudents who asked their parents to buy them a smartphone\tStudents whose parents gave them a smartphone without being asked\nUsing a smartphone for less than 4\xa0h a day\tProactive high self-control\tReactive high self-control\nUsing a smartphone for more than 4\xa0h a day\tProactive low self-control\tReactive low self-control\nOpen in a new tab\n\nRegarding internal consistency among the constructs, the Cronbach\'s α values ranged from 0.850 to 0.884. According to the guidelines established by George and Mallery (2010), these values were acceptable because they exceeded 0.7. The overall Cronbach\'s α for the constructs was 0.922. The Cronbach\'s α value of the smartphone behavior construct was 0.850, whereas that of the academic performance construct was 0.884.\n\nData analysis\n\nThe participants’ demographic characteristics and smartphone use (expressed as frequencies and percentages) were subjected to a descriptive analysis. To examine hypotheses 1 and 2, an independent samples t test (for gender and grade) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to test the differences in smartphone use and learning effectiveness with respect to academic performance among elementary school students under various background variables. To test hypothesis 3, Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the association between smartphone behavior and academic performance. To test hypothesis 4, one-way multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was employed to examine differences in smartphone behavior and its impacts on learning effectiveness. To test Hypothesis 5, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance.\n\nResults\nDescriptive analysis\n\nThe descriptive analysis (Table 1) revealed that the parents of 71.1% of the participants (n\u2009=\u2009499) conditionally controlled their smartphone use. Moreover, 42.5% of the participants noted that they started using smartphones in grade 3 or 4. Notably, 43.3% reported that they used their parents’ old smartphones; in other words, almost half of the students used secondhand smartphones. Overall, 79% of the participants indicated that they most frequently used their smartphones after school. Regarding smartphone use on weekends, 54.1% and 44.1% used their smartphones during the daytime and nighttime, respectively. Family members and classmates (45.1% and 43.3%, respectively) were the people that the participants communicated with the most on their smartphones. Regarding bringing their smartphones to school, 53.1% of the participants indicated that they were most concerned about losing their phones. As for smartphone use duration, 28.3% of the participants indicated that they used their smartphones for less than 1\xa0h a day, whereas 24.4% reported using them for 1 to 2\xa0h a day.\n\nTable 1.\n\nDescriptive analysis results\n\nDemographic variable\tVariable\tNumber\tPercentage (%)\nGender\tMale\t238\t47.7\nFemale\t261\t52.3\nGrade\tFifth\t244\t48.9\nSixth\t255\t51.1\nWhat are your parents\' attitudes toward controlling your smartphone use (Parental control)\tStrict\t46\t9.2\nConditional\t355\t71.1\nNone\t98\t19.6\nWhen did you first start using a smartphone?\tBefore elementary school\t96\t19.2\nGrades 1 to 2\t118\t23.6\nGrades 3 to 4\t212\t42.5\nGrades 5 to 6\t73\t14.6\nHow did you obtain your smartphone?\tMy parents bought it for me\t184\t36.9\nMy parents gave me their old smartphone\t216\t43.3\nI asked my parents to buy it for me\t35\t7\nI asked my parents, and they gave me their old smartphone\t64\t12.8\nWhen do you use your smartphone the most often?\tBefore school\t8\t1.6\nAfter school\t394\t79\nAt school\t97\t19.4\nAt what time of day do you most frequently use your smartphone on weekends?\tDaytime\t270\t54.1\nNighttime\t220\t44.1\nAll day\t9\t1.8\nWho do you contact the most often on your smartphone?\tFamily member(s)\t225\t45.1\nTeacher(s)\t2\t0.4\nClassmate(s)\t221\t44.3\nOthers\t51\t10.2\nDo you usually bring your smartphone to school?\tYes\t26\t5.2\nNo\t393\t78.8\nDepends on the situation\t80\t16\nWhat is your greatest concern about bringing your smartphone to school?\tI’m not concerned about this\t73\t14.6\nThat I’ll lose it\t265\t53.1\nThat it’ll be confiscated\t64\t12.8\nThat it’ll be compared with my classmates’ smartphones\t6\t1.2\nThat my classmates will use it\t36\t7.2\nOther\t55\t11\nWhat is your greatest concern about smartphone use?\tI’m not concerned about this\t212\t42.5\nSignal interference\t124\t24.8\nAn increase in my phone bill\t16\t3.2\nEffects of electromagnetic radiation\t32\t6.4\nNegative effects on my studies\t78\t15.6\nOther\t37\t7.4\nHow much time do you spend on your smartphone in a day?\tLess than 1\xa0h\t141\t28.3\n1 to 2\xa0h\t122\t24.4\n2 to 3\xa0h\t80\t16\n3 to 4\xa0h\t58\t11.6\nMore than 4\xa0h\t98\t19.6\nSelf-control\tProactive high self-control\t278\t55.7\nReactive high self-control\t66\t13\nProactive low self-control\t122\t24.4\nReactive low self-control\t34\t6.8\nOpen in a new tab\nSmartphone behavior varies with parental control and based on students\' self-control\n\nWe used the question ‘How did you obtain your smartphone?’ (to investigate proactivity), and ‘How much time do you spend on your smartphone in a day?’ (to investigate the effects of students\' self-control). According to the Hsieh and Lin (2021), and Peng et al. (2022), addition is defined more than 4\xa0h a day are defined as smartphone addiction (meaning that students have low self-control).\n\nTable 2 gives the cross-tabulation results for self-control ability. Students who asked their parents to buy a smartphone, but use it for less than 4\xa0h a day are defined as having ‘Proactive high self-control’; students using a smartphone for more than 4\xa0h a day are defined as having ‘Proactive low self-control’. Students whose parents gave them a smartphone but use them for less than 4\xa0h a day are defined as having ‘Reactive high self-control’; students given smart phones and using them for more than 4\xa0h a day are defined as having ‘Reactive low self-control’; others, we define as having moderate levels of self-control.\n\nTables 3–5 present the results of the t test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on differences in the smartphone behaviors based on parental control and students\' self-control. As mentioned, smartphone behavior can be classified into three dimensions: interpersonal communication, leisure and entertainment, and information searches. Table 3 lists the significant independent variables in the first dimension of smartphone behavior based on parental control and students\' self-control. Among the students using their smartphones for the purpose of communication, the proportion of parents enforcing no control over smartphone use was significantly higher than the proportions of parents enforcing strict or conditional control (F\u2009=\u200911.828, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This indicates that the lack of parental control over smartphone use leads to the participants spending more time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication.\n\nTable 3.\n\nSignificant independent variables (Parental control and Self-control) in the first dimension (interpersonal communication) of smartphone use\n\nIndependent variable\tVariable\tNumber\tMean\tSD\tF value\tA posteriori comparison\nParental control\t(1) Strict\t46\t3.13\t1.17\t11.82***\t3\u2009>\u20091,2\n(2) Conditional\t355\t3.51\t0.99\n(3) None\t98\t3.93\t0.84\nSelf-control\t(1) Proactive high self-control\t278\t3.47\t0.05\t18.88***\t1,3,4\u2009>\u20092\n(2) Reactive high self-control\t66\t2.95\t0.11\n(3) Proactive low self-control\t122\t3.98\t0.08\n(4) Reactive low self-control\t34\t3.91\t1.16\nOpen in a new tab\n\n*** p\u2009<\u2009.001\n\nTable 5.\n\nIndependent variables (Parental control and Self-control) in the third dimension (information searches) of smartphone behavior\n\nIndependent variable\tVariable\tNumber\tMean\tSD\tt value/F value\tA posteriori comparison\nGender\tMale (boys)\t238\t3.52\t0.96\t\u2009−\u20093.979***\tgirls\u2009>\u2009boys\nFemale (girls)\t261\t3.74\t0.88\nParental control\t(1) Strict\t46\t3.77\t1.05\t0.72\t\n(2) Conditional\t355\t3.60\t0.92\n(3) None\t98\t3.67\t0.88\nSelf-control\t(1) Proactive high self-control\t278\t3.63\t0.94\t0.35\t\n(2) Reactive high self-control\t66\t3.62\t1.00\n(3) Proactive low self-control\t122\t3.62\t0.86\n(4) Reactive low self-control\t34\t3.67\t0.91\nOpen in a new tab\n\nSD standard deviation\n\n*** p\u2009<\u2009.001\n\nFor the independent variable of self-control, regardless of whether students had proactive high self-control, proactive low self-control or reactive low self-control, significantly higher levels of interpersonal communication than reactive high self-control were reported (F\u2009=\u200918.88, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This means that students effectively able to control themselves, who had not asked their parents to buy them smartphones, spent less time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication. However, students with high self-control but who had asked their parents to buy them smartphones, would spend more time on interpersonal communication (meaning that while they may not spend a lot of time on their smartphones each day, the time spent on interpersonal communication is no different than for the other groups). Those without effective self-control, regardless of whether they had actively asked their parents to buy them a smartphone or not, would spend more time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication.\n\nTable 4 displays the independent variables (parental control and students\' self-control) significant in the dimension of leisure and entertainment. Among the students using their smartphones for this purpose, the proportion of parents enforcing no control over smartphone use was significantly higher than the proportions of parents enforcing strict or conditional control (F\u2009=\u20098.539, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This indicates that the lack of parental control over smartphone use leads to the participants spending more time using their smartphones for leisure and entertainment.\n\nTable 4.\n\nSignificant independent variables (Parental control and Self-control) in the second dimension (leisure and entertainment) of smartphone behavior\n\nIndependent variable\tVariable\tNumber\tMean\tSD\tF value\tA posteriori comparison\nParental control\t(1) Strict\t46\t3.11\t0.87\t8.53***\t3\u2009>\u20091,2\n(2) Conditional\t355\t3.37\t0.65\n(3) None\t98\t3.59\t0.67\nSelf-control\t(1) Proactive high self-control\t278\t3.31\t0.69\t8.77***\t3,4\u2009>\u20091,2\n(2) Reactive high self-control\t66\t3.19\t0.76\n(3) Proactive low self-control\t122\t3.62\t0.57\n(4) Reactive low self-control\t34\t3.59\t0.59\nOpen in a new tab\n\nSD standard deviation\n\n*** p\u2009<\u2009.001\n\nFor the independent variable of self-control, students with proactive low self-control and reactive low self-control reported significantly higher use of smartphones for leisure and entertainment than did students with proactive high self-control and reactive high self-control (F\u2009=\u20098.77, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This means that students who cannot control themselves, whether proactive or passive in terms of asking their parents to buy them a smartphone, will spend more time using their smartphones for leisure and entertainment.\n\nTable 5 presents the significant independent variables in the dimension of information searching. Significant differences were observed only for gender, with a significantly higher proportion of girls using their smartphones to search for information (t\u2009=\u2009\u2009−\u20093.979, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Parental control and students\' self-control had no significance in the dimension of information searching. This means that the parents\' attitudes towards control did not affect the students\' use of smartphones for information searches. This is conceivable, as Asian parents generally discourage their children from using their smartphones for non-study related activities (such as entertainment or making friends), but not for learning-related activities. It is also worth noting that student self-control was not significant in relation to searching for information. This means that it makes no difference whether or not students have self-control in their search for learning-related information.\n\nFour notable results are presented as follows.\n\nFirst, a significantly higher proportion of girls used their smartphones to search for information. Second, if smartphone use was not subject to parental control, the participants spent more time using their smartphones for interpersonal communication and for leisure and entertainment rather than for information searches. This means that if parents make the effort to control their children\'s smartphone use, this will reduce their children\'s use of smartphones for interpersonal communication and entertainment. Third, student self-control affects smartphone use behavior for interpersonal communication and entertainment (but not searching for information). This does not mean that they spend more time on their smartphones in their daily lives, it means that they spend the most time interacting with people while using their smartphones (For example, they may only spend 2–3\xa0h a day using their smartphone. During those 2–3\xa0h, they spend more than 90% of their time interacting with people and only 10% doing other things), which is the fourth result.\n\nThese results support hypotheses 1 and 2.\n\nPearson’s correlation analysis of smartphone behavior and academic performance\n\nTable 6 presents the results of Pearson’s correlation analysis of smartphone behavior and academic performance. Except for information searches and learning attitudes, all variables exhibited significant and positively correlations. In short, there was a positive correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance. Thus, hypothesis 3 is supported.\n\nTable 6.\n\nPearson’s correlation analysis of smartphone use and academic performance\n\nVariable\tInterpersonal communication\tLeisure and entertainment\tInformation searches\tSmartphone behavior\nLearning activities\t.369**\t.342**\t176**\t.382**\nLearning applications\t.436**\t.435**\t.472**\t.565**\nLearning attitudes\t.286**\t.330**\t.027\t.286**\nAcademic performance\t.486**\t.493**\t.321**\t.557**\nOpen in a new tab\n\n** p\u2009<\u2009.01\n\nAnalysis of differences in the academic performance of students with different smartphone behaviors\n\nDifferences in smartphone behavior and its impacts on learning effectiveness with regard to academic performance were examined through. In step 1, cluster analysis was conducted to convert continuous variables into discrete variables. In step 2, a one-way MANOVA was performed to analyze differences in the academic performance of students with varying smartphone behavior. Regarding the cluster analysis results (Table 7), the value of the change in the Bayesian information criterion in the second cluster was\u2009−\u2009271.954, indicating that it would be appropriate to group the data. Specifically, we assigned the participants into either the high smartphone use group or the low smartphone use group, comprised of 230 and 269 participants (46.1% and 53.9%), respectively.\n\nTable 7.\n\nCluster analysis results\n\nNumber of Clusters\tBIC\tBIC change\tRatio of BIC change\tRatio of distance measures\n1\t1073.416\t\t\t\n2\t801.463\t\u2009−\u2009271.954\t1.000\t2.397\n3\t709.753\t\u2009−\u200991.710\t.337\t1.880\n4\t678.418\t\u2009−\u200931.335\t.115\t1.378\n5\t665.887\t\u2009−\u200912.531\t.046\t1.120\n6\t658.695\t\u2009−\u20097.192\t.026\t1.052\n7\t653.697\t\u2009−\u20094.998\t.018\t1.142\n8\t653.969\t.272\t\u2009−\u2009.001\t1.674\n9\t669.141\t15.172\t\u2009−\u2009.056\t1.179\n10\t687.669\t18.528\t\u2009−\u2009.068\t1.178\n11\t709.026\t21.357\t\u2009−\u2009.079\t1.018\n12\t730.666\t21.640\t\u2009−\u2009.080\t1.088\n13\t753.570\t22.904\t\u2009−\u2009.084\t1.140\n14\t778.241\t24.671\t\u2009−\u2009.091\t1.009\n15\t803.025\t24.785\t\u2009−\u2009.091\t1.057\nOpen in a new tab\n\nBIC Bayesian information criterion\n\nThe MANOVA was preceded by the Levene test for the equality of variance, which revealed nonsignificant results, F(6, 167,784.219)\u2009=\u20091.285, p\u2009>\u20090.05.

The a posteriori comparison demonstrated that the high smartphone use group significantly outperformed the low smartphone use group in all dependent variables with regard to academic performance.

We examined the impact through the following four-step process:\n\nStep 1. The independent variable (parental control and students\' self-control) must have a significant effect on the dependent variable (academic performance), as in model 1 (please see Fig.\xa01).\n\nStep 2. The independent variable (parental control and students\' self-control) must have a significant effect on the mediating variable (smartphone behaviors), as in model 2 (please see Fig.\xa02).\n\nStep 3. When both the independent variable (parental control and student self-control) and the mediator (smartphone behavior) are used as predictors, the mediating variable (smartphone behavior) must have a significant effect on the dependent variable (academic performance), as in model 3 (please see Fig.\xa03).\n\nStep 4. In model 3, the regression coefficient of the independent variables (parental control and student self-control) on the dependent variables must be less than in mode 1 or become insignificant.\n\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nModel 2: Model to test the impact of parental control and students’ self-control on smartphone behavior\n\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nModel 3: Both independent variables (parental control and student self-control) and mediators (smartphone behavior) were used as predictors to predict dependent variables\n\nAs can be seen in Fig.\xa01, parental control and student self-control are observed variables, and smartphone behavior is a latent variable. "Strict" is set to 0, which means "Conditional", with "None" compared to "Strict". “Proactive high self-control” is also set to 0. From Fig.\xa01 we find that the independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable. The regression coefficient of parental control is 0.176, t\u2009=\u20093.45 (p\u2009<\u20090.01); the regression coefficient of students’ self-control is 0.218, t\u2009=\u20094.12 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), proving the fit of the model (Chi Square\u2009=\u200913.96**, df\u2009=\u20094, GFI\u2009=\u20090.989, AGFI\u2009=\u20090.959, CFI\u2009=\u20090.996, TLI\u2009=\u20090.915, RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.051, SRMR\u2009=\u20090.031). Therefore, the test results for Model 1 are in line with the recommendations of Baron and Kenny (1986).\n\nAs can be seen in Fig.\xa02, the independent variables have a significant effect on smartphone behaviors. The regression coefficient of parental control is 0.166, t\u2009=\u20093.11 (p\u2009<\u20090.01); the regression coefficient of students’ self-control is 0.149, t\u2009=\u20092.85 (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The coefficients of the model fit are: Chi Square\u2009=\u200915.10**, df\u2009=\u20094, GFI\u2009=\u20090.988, AGFI\u2009=\u20090.954, CFI\u2009=\u20090.973, TLI\u2009=\u20090.932, RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.052, SRMR\u2009=\u20090.039. Therefore, the results of the test of Model 2 are in line with the recommendations of Baron and Kenny (1986).\n\nAs can be seen in Fig.\xa03, smartphone behaviors have a significant effect on the dependent variable. The regression coefficient is 0.664, t\u2009=\u200910.2 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The coefficients of the model fit are: Chi Square\u2009=\u200991.04**, df\u2009=\u200916, GFI\u2009=\u20090.958, AGFI\u2009=\u20090.905, CFI\u2009=\u20090.918, TLI\u2009=\u20090.900, RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.077, SRMR\u2009=\u20090.063. Therefore, the results of the test of Model 3 are in line with the recommendations of Baron and Kenny (1986).\n\nAs can be seen in Fig.\xa04, the regression coefficient of the independent variables (parental control and student self-control) on the dependent variables is less than in model 1, and the parental control variable becomes insignificant. The regression coefficient of parental control is 0.013, t\u2009=\u20090.226 (p\u2009>\u20090.05); the path coefficient of students’ self-control is 0.155, t\u2009=\u20093.07 (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\n\nFig. 4.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nModel 4: Model three’s regression coefficient of the independent variables (parental control and student self-control) on the dependent variables\n\nTo sum up, we prove that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable to impact the academic performance. Thus, hypothesis 5 is supported.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study investigated differences in the smartphone behavior of fifth and sixth graders in Taiwan with different background variables (focus on parental control and students’ self-control) and their effects on academic performance. The correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance was also examined. Although smartphones are being used in elementary school learning activities, relatively few studies have explored their effects on academic performance. In this study, the proportion of girls who used smartphones to search for information was significantly higher than that of boys. Past studies have been inconclusive about gender differences in smartphone use. Lee and Kim (2018) observed no gender differences in smartphone use, but did note that boys engaged in more smartphone use if their parents set fewer restrictions. Kim et al. (2019) found that boys exhibited higher levels of smartphone dependency than girls. By contrast, Kim (2017) reported that girls had higher levels of smartphone dependency than boys did. Most relevant studies have focused on smartphone dependency; comparatively little attention has been devoted to smartphone behavior. The present study contributes to the literature in this regard.\n\nNotably, this study found that parental control affected smartphone use. If the participants’ parents imposed no restrictions, students spent more time on leisure and entertainment and on interpersonal communication rather than on information searches. This is conceivable, as Asian parents generally discourage their children from using their smartphones for non-study related activities (such as entertainment or making friends) but not for learning-related activities. If Asian parents believe that using a smartphone can improve their child\'s academic performance, they will encourage their child to use it. Parents in Taiwan attach great importance to their children\'s academic performance (Lee et al., 2016). A considerable amount of research has been conducted on parental attitudes or control in this context. Hwang and Jeong (2015) suggested that parental attitudes mediated their children’s smartphone use. Similarly, Chang et al. (2019) observed that parental attitudes mediated the smartphone use of children in Taiwan. Our results are consistent with extant evidence in this regard. Lee and Ogbolu (2018) demonstrated that the stronger children’s perception was of parental control over their smartphone use, the more frequently they used their smartphones. The study did not further explain the activities the children engaged in on their smartphones after they increased their frequency of use. In the present study, the participants spent more time on their smartphones for leisure and entertainment and for interpersonal communication than for information searches.\n\nNotably, this study also found that students’ self-control affected smartphone use.\n\nRegarding the Pearson’s correlation analysis of smartphone behavior and academic performance, except for information searches and learning attitudes, all the variables were significantly positively correlated. In other words, there was a positive correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance. In their systematic review, Amez and Beart (2020) determined that most empirical results provided evidence of a negative correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance, playing a more considerable role in that relationship than the theoretical mechanisms or empirical methods in the studies they examined. The discrepancy between our results and theirs can be explained by the between-study variations in the definitions of learning achievement or performance.\n\nRegarding the present results on the differences in the academic performance of students with varying smartphone behaviors, we carried out a cluster analysis, dividing the participants into a high smartphone use group and a low smartphone use group. Subsequent MANOVA revealed that the high smartphone use group academically outperformed the low smartphone use group; significant differences were noted in the academic performance of students with different smartphone behaviors. Given the observed correlation between smartphone behavior and academic performance, this result is not unexpected. The findings on the relationship between smartphone behavior and academic performance can be applied to smartphone use in the context of education.\n\nFinally, in a discussion of whether smartphone behavior is a mediator of academic performance, it is proved that smartphone behavior is the mediating variable impacting academic performance. Our findings show that parental control and students’ self-control can affect academic performance. However, the role of the mediating variable (smartphone use behavior) means that changes in parental control have no effect on academic achievement at all. This means that smartphone use behaviors have a full mediating effect on parental control. It is also found that students’ self-control has a partial mediating effect. Our findings suggest that parental attitudes towards the control of smartphone use and students\' self-control do affect academic performance, but smartphone use behavior has a significant mediating effect on this. In other words, it is more important to understand the children\'s smartphone behavior than to control their smartphone usage. There have been many studies in the past exploring the mediator variables for smartphone use addiction and academic performance. For instance, Ahmed et al. (2020) found that the mediating variables of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and attitude have a significant and positive influence in the relationship between smartphone functions. Cho and Lee (2017) found that parental attitude is the mediating variable for smartphone use addiction. Cho et al. (2017) indicated that stress had a significant influence on smartphone addiction, while self-control mediates that influence. In conclusion, the outcomes demonstrate that parental control and students’ self-control do influence student academic performance in primary school. Previous studies have offered mixed results as to whether smartphone usage has an adverse or affirmative influence on student academic performance. This study points out a new direction, thinking of smartphone use behavior as a mediator.\n\nIn brief, the participants spent more smartphone time on leisure and entertainment and interpersonal communication, but the academic performance of the high smartphone use group surpassed that of the low smartphone use group. This result may clarify the role of students’ communication skills in their smartphone use. As Kang and Jung (2014) noted, conventional communication methods have been largely replaced by mobile technologies. This suggests that students’ conventional communication skills are also shifting to accommodate smartphone use. Elementary students are relatively confident in communicating with others through smartphones; thus, they likely have greater self‐efficacy in this regard and in turn may be better able to improve their academic performance by leveraging mobile technologies. This premise requires verification through further research. Notably, high smartphone use suggests the greater availability of time and opportunity in this regard. Conversely, low smartphone use suggests the relative lack of such time and opportunity. The finding that the high smartphone use group academically outperformed the low smartphone use group also indicates that smartphone accessibility constitutes a potential inequality in the learning opportunities of elementary school students. Therefore, elementary school teachers must be aware of this issue, especially in view of the shift to online learning triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, when many students are dependent on smartphones and computers for online learning.\n\nConclusions and implications\n\nThis study examined the relationship between smartphone behavior and academic performance for fifth and sixth graders in Taiwan. Various background variables (parental control and students’ self-control) were also considered. The findings provide new insights into student attitudes toward smartphone use and into the impacts of smartphone use on academic performance. Smartphone behavior and academic performance were correlated. The students in the high smartphone use group academically outperformed the low smartphone use group. This result indicates that smartphone use constitutes a potential inequality in elementary school students’ learning opportunities. This can be explained as follows: high smartphone use suggests that the participants had sufficient time and opportunity to access and use smartphones. Conversely, low smartphone use suggests that the participants did not have sufficient time and opportunity for this purpose. Students’ academic performance may be adversely affected by fewer opportunities for access. Disparities between their performance and that of their peers with ready access to smartphones may widen amid the prevalent class suspension and school closure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis study has laid down the basic foundations for future studies concerning the influence of smartphones on student academic performance in primary school as the outcome variable. This model can be replicated and applied to other social science variables which can influence the academic performance of primary school students as the outcome variable. Moreover, the outcomes of this study can also provide guidelines to teachers, parents, and policymakers on how smartphones can be most effectively used to derive the maximum benefits in relation to academic performance in primary school as the outcome variable. Finally, the discussion of the mediating variable can also be used as the basis for the future projects.\n\nLimitations and areas of future research\n\nThis research is significant in the field of smartphone functions and the student academic performance for primary school students. However, certain limitations remain. The small number of students sampled is the main problem in this study. For more generalized results, the sample data may be taken across countries within the region and increased in number (rather than limited to certain cities and countries). For more robust results, data might also be obtained from both rural and urban centers. In this study, only one mediating variable was incorporated, but in future studies, several other psychological and behavioral variables might be included for more comprehensive outcomes. We used the SEM-based multivariate approach which does not address the cause and effect between the variables, therefore, in future work, more robust models could be employed for cause-and-effect investigation amongst the variables.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the school participants in the study.\n\nAppendix 1 Factor analysis results\nAuthor contributions\n\nKung and Wang conceived of the presented idea.

The provided text is relevant to the research topic of the effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality among teenagers. However, the study primarily focuses on the adult population in India, aged 20 to 60 years, rather than teenagers. Despite this, the findings can offer insights into the broader implications of mobile phone usage on sleep quality, which may be applicable to teenagers as well.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Study Overview**: 
   - Conducted at two tertiary care hospitals in North India from July 2014 to September 2019.
   - Involved 566 participants aged 20 to 60 years.
   - Aimed to assess the impact of mobile phone usage on sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), actigraphy, and polysomnography.

2. **Key Results**:
   - 22.61% of participants had poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 5).
   - Higher mobile phone usage was significantly associated with poorer sleep quality (P=0.01).
   - Participants with higher mobile phone usage had shorter latency from sleep onset to N2 and N3 sleep stages.

3. **Methodology**:
   - Sleep quality was assessed using the PSQI questionnaire.
   - Actigraphy and polysomnography were used to objectively measure sleep parameters in subsets of participants.

4. **Demographics**:
   - Mean age of participants was 31.03 years.
   - 57.60% were male, and 42.4% had an undergraduate degree.
   - 39% of participants were classified as high mobile phone users based on the frequency of calls and SMS.

5. **Discussion**:
   - High mobile phone usage is a risk factor for sleep disturbances.
   - The study suggests that mobile phone usage, especially at bedtime, increases sleep latency and affects sleep quality.
   - The findings align with previous studies indicating that mobile phone usage can disrupt sleep patterns.

6. **Limitations**:
   - The study focused on adults, not teenagers.
   - Mobile phone usage was self-reported, which may introduce bias.
   - The study did not account for the use of social media platforms, which are prevalent among teenagers.

### Conclusion:
While the study does not directly address teenagers, it highlights the potential negative impact of mobile phone usage on sleep quality, which could be extrapolated to younger populations. The findings suggest that excessive mobile phone use, particularly before bedtime, may lead to poor sleep quality, increased sleep latency, and disrupted sleep stages. Further research specifically targeting teenagers is needed to confirm these effects in that demographic.

The provided text is a comprehensive study on the impact of smartphone use on learning effectiveness, specifically focusing on elementary school students. While the study does not directly address the impact of smartphone usage on academic performance in teenagers, it provides valuable insights that can be extrapolated to understand potential effects on teenagers.

### Summary of the Study:

1. **Objective and Methodology**:
   - The study aimed to investigate the effects of smartphone use on the perceived academic performance of elementary school students.
   - It employed various statistical analyses, including descriptive analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and structural equation modeling (SEM), to explore the relationship between smartphone behavior and academic performance.

2. **Key Findings**:
   - **Smartphone Use and Academic Performance**: The study found a positive correlation between smartphone use and academic performance among elementary school students. Students in the high smartphone use group outperformed those in the low smartphone use group academically.
   - **Mediating Role of Smartphone Behavior**: Smartphone behavior was identified as a mediating variable impacting academic performance. This suggests that how students use smartphones (e.g., for learning activities, communication, or entertainment) significantly affects their academic outcomes.
   - **Parental Control and Self-Control**: The study highlighted the importance of parental control and students' self-control in influencing smartphone use behavior. Lack of parental control was associated with increased use of smartphones for leisure and entertainment rather than educational purposes. Students with higher self-control were better able to manage their smartphone use effectively.

3. **Implications**:
   - The findings suggest that smartphone use can create inequalities in learning opportunities, as students with greater access to smartphones may have more opportunities to enhance their academic performance.
   - The study emphasizes the need for educators and policymakers to consider the role of smartphones in education and to develop strategies that maximize their positive impact on learning.

4. **Limitations and Future Research**:
   - The study was limited to elementary school students in Taiwan, and the sample size was relatively small. Future research could expand the sample size and include diverse geographic locations to generalize the findings.
   - Additional psychological and behavioral variables could be explored to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of smartphone use on academic performance.

### Extrapolation to Teenagers:
While the study focuses on elementary school students, the findings can be relevant to teenagers, as both groups are in developmental stages where technology use is prevalent. The positive correlation between smartphone use and academic performance, mediated by the nature of smartphone activities, suggests that teenagers could also benefit academically from structured and educational smartphone use. However, the potential for distraction and the need for self-control and parental guidance remain critical factors to consider.

In conclusion, the study provides a nuanced view of how smartphone use can impact academic performance, highlighting the importance of the context and manner of smartphone use. These insights can inform strategies to optimize smartphone use for educational purposes among teenagers.

Future research could expand the sample size and include diverse geographic locations to generalize the findings.\n   - Additional psychological and behavioral variables could be explored to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of smartphone use on academic performance.\n\n### Extrapolation to Teenagers:\nWhile the study focuses on elementary school students, the findings can be relevant to teenagers, as both groups are in developmental stages where technology use is prevalent. The positive correlation between smartphone use and academic performance, mediated by the nature of smartphone activities, suggests that teenagers could also benefit academically from structured and educational smartphone use. However, the potential for distraction and the need for self-control and parental guidance remain critical factors to consider.\n\nIn conclusion, the study provides a nuanced view of how smartphone use can impact academic performance, highlighting the importance of the context and manner of smartphone use. These insights can inform strategies to optimize smartphone use for educational purposes among teenagers.\n\n### Requirements\nPlease provide a detailed research report in response to the following topic: "What are the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among teenagers, and how might restricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools improve these outcomes?", using the information provided above. The report must meet the following requirements:\n\n- Focus on directly addressing the chosen topic.\n- Ensure a well-structured and in-depth presentation, incorporating relevant facts and figures where available.\n- Present data and findings in an intuitive manner, utilizing feature comparative tables, if applicable.\n- The report should have a minimum word count of 2,000 and be formatted with Markdown syntax following APA style guidelines.\n- Include all source URLs in APA format at the end of the report.\n'}]

Abstract

Smartphones are an integral part of our lives due to benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment including games. The many benefits of a smartphone, like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are however balanced by negative health consequences. Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Sleep plays a crucial role in memory and is essential for all stages of learning. Restorative sleep may also prepare the brain for new learning. The use of smartphones could disrupt lifestyle, sleep, and potentially, multiple cellular processes through their impact on circadian rhythms and lead to significant and widespread morbidity and mortality. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. These findings must be seen against the background of widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone use and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance. The implications of circadian disruption for learning populations, such as university students and professionals training for careers in medicine, and other critical occupations, cannot be overstated. This review highlights the possible negative consequences of smartphone use on overall sleep health while emphasizing the importance of studying its impact, on mental health and learning outcomes, in different populations. The review aimed to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and the consequences for their academic achievement. The method used was a comprehensive search strategy using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases with appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.

Introduction and background

Mobile phones are mass-produced electronic devices that are an integral part of our lives due to benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment, including games. They are popular, especially because they provide these benefits instantly, due to their portability and size [1].

Smartphones, on the other hand, are technologically more advanced mobile devices, which can perform many of the functions of a computer, in addition to those of mobile phones, while having the same convenience and form factor. Given the multifaceted applications of a smartphone, it has also progressively become an intrinsic part of our lives and relationships. 

The many benefits of a smartphone like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are, however, balanced by negative health consequences, including neck pain, accidents, poor mental health, and sleep disturbances [2]. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. A systematic review of Indian adolescents revealed that smartphone addiction among adolescents was 39% to 44% on average. Nearly 300 million of the Indian population uses smartphones [3]. Surveys suggest that up to 50% of teens and 27% of their parents feel that they may be addicted to mobile phones [4].

These negative health consequences are repeatedly highlighted by the popular press. However, it must be kept in mind that many of these negative health consequences of smartphone use are speculative and alarmist. Mental health professionals need to have actionable evidence to counsel their clients in a balanced and appropriate manner based on available scientific evidence [5-6]. 

The objective of this clinically oriented comprehensive review was to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and its consequences on their academic achievement. The methodology used was a comprehensive search strategy in Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases using appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.

Review

Methodology

To conduct this review, a comprehensive search was undertaken using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Keywords include “adolescents”, “psychiatry and mental health”, “learning”, “sleep pattern”, and "smartphone usage”. The search results were supplemented by reviewing the bibliographies of the articles found, ensuring a thorough exploration of the subject matter related to the influence of smartphone usage on sleep patterns, mental health, and the academic performance of adolescents. 

Negative aspects of widespread smartphone use

People using smartphones have problems structuring their daily routines due to the disruptive impact of notifications and screen time. When it comes to students, sleep disturbances may in addition interfere with their ability to reach their classrooms, pay attention, and ability to focus and learn [7]. The result is an inefficient lifestyle with subpar academic outcomes, leading to stress and poor mental health. Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the impact of smartphone use on sleep. First, the bright light emitted suppresses the secretion of melatonin reducing sleep efficiency, delaying sleep onset, and disrupting circadian rhythms [7].

Second, sleep displacement occurs, when the smartphone is used as an unstructured leisure time activity with no predefined beginning and end point, unlike real-world games and other entertainment activities like attending theatrical performances, movies, and arcades [8].

Third, sleep can be affected by the content consumed through the smartphone such as activating music, arousing sexual or violent images, and video games requiring hyper-alertness to anticipate the required responses. Not surprisingly, studies have found that mobile phone usage is associated with short sleep duration, reduced sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. There is also some evidence to suggest that this relationship may be bidirectional, especially in adults where insomnia may be the cause and not the outcome of mobile use [8].

The Millennium Cohort Survey containing 11,553 responses suggested later bedtime and shorter nighttime sleep duration are associated with hyperactivity and inattention. Indeed sleep deprivation was found to exert a modulatory effect on the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation and depression in adolescents [9].

In particular, bedtime smartphone use is predictive of later rising time, longer sleep latency, and worse sleep efficiency. The screen light emitted by mobile phones is of short wavelength and towards the blue length of the light spectrum, which is likely to delay sleep onset for a long duration after exposure. Therefore, screen time guidelines have been evolved for the various age groups specifically affected by smartphone addiction [10]. According to the Australian Department of Health (ADH), the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the recommended screen time for adolescents should not exceed more than two hours per day [11]. 

Biological aspects

In mammals, multiple physiological, endocrine, behavioral, and molecular rhythms are governed by an endogenous clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. It runs freely to a cycle of around 40 minutes and, therefore, needs to be re-synchronized with 24 hours per day. To reset this clock and synchronize it with the solar day, the SCN is entrained daily, by the dark-light cycle to which the organism is exposed [12].

A phase shift in the circadian rhythms of the SCN results in alterations of both the bedtime and wake-up time of an individual which moves to a time earlier in the day (phase advance) or later in the day (phase delay). Light exposure suppresses the melatonin secretion and resets the phase of the SCN, which depends on the timing, intensity, wavelength, duration, and previous exposures to light or darkness. Light exposure, early in the biological night induces a phase delay while exposure late in the night and towards the early morning elicits a phase advance. Notably, these responses are present in blind people also, since the photoreceptors wired for the circadian entrainment are distinct from the rods and the cones of the visual system. These circadian photoreceptors have their peak sensitivity to a light wavelength in the range of 446 to 477 nm (visible short wavelength). Thus, a short wavelength approximately of 460 nm blue light exposure at night evokes a greater phase shift, thus alerting the responses and causing melatonin suppression when compared to other wavelength light in the visual range of 380 to 700 nm. Evidence indicates that these spectrally targeted blue light sources are more efficient in evoking circadian changes such as alertness, faster reaction time, attention lapses, and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while measuring the electrical activity of the brain [12].

Circadian photoreceptors in the retina use melanopsin as photopigment. Along with these receptors, there are specialized ganglion cells that project directly to the SCN. Human circadian rhythms like those of other diurnal species are sensitive to light throughout the biological day. Indeed there is no part of the biological day where light exposure does not affect the circadian rhythms. However, there is a phase delay period in the early biological night and a phase advance region in the late biological night with the transition region occurring late in the biological night. These shifts are evident even with light exposure for a couple of days in a week [12]. 

The human circadian system is sensitive to even low-intensity light especially if it follows many hours of darkness. Most studies show that modern humans get relatively little bright light exposure and spend most of the day in indoor light with an intensity of 200 lux. Such individuals become sensitive to even modest light intensity of 1,000 lux. In addition, even brief flashes of light can be incorporated into the human circadian rhythm if they occur after dark periods. Supplementary to the regular sleep times with darkness during the day, studies have shown that intermittent exposure to bright light throughout the night causes the aligning of the circadian rhythms with the nightshift work schedules [13,14].

The physiological functions of human beings exhibit approximately a 24-hour rhythm. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the molecular mechanism regulating these rhythms. This molecular mechanism comprises genes that increase the transcription of other genes, whose products, in turn, exert a negative feedback, on their gene expression. This autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop is present in every cell of the body. These feedback loops affect many genes that sub-serve the functioning and the timing of cell biology. These individual cellular clocks are kept in synchrony by the neural network that connects them to the central circadian clock of the organism [13,14].

In addition to this genetic mechanism, there have been circadian rhythms noted even in non-nucleated cells such as red blood cells. These non-genetic mechanisms could interact with the gene transcription-translation loops in unknown ways. These mechanisms point to the existence of the primal circadian clock that could be common to all species. The ability of visible light to synchronize with the biological clock of the photosynthetic marine dinoflagellate (Gonyaulax polyedra) has been known since 1958 [13,14].

Human chronobiology

The SCN plays a critical role in regulating photoperiodic behavior and physiology such as sleep, wakefulness, alertness, feeding, hunting/ aggressions, seasonal reproduction, body temperature, and hibernation [15].

A photoreceptive net consisting of the retinal ganglion cells and their axons (containing melanopsin), communicates directly with the brain influencing the circadian rhythms and the pupillary size, through projection to the SCN and the olivary pretectal nuclei, respectively. This photoreceptive system (as opposed to the functionally distinct visual system) encodes and transmits information about the ambient light intensity. Through this system, gross environmental illumination is integrated into the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neural behavioral systems of the human nervous system. Blue light appears to be the strongest synchronizing agent responsible for resetting the circadian rhythm, to keep the biological rhythms and the psycho-behavioral rhythms in phase with the solar day [14]. In humans, bright blue light between 0500 and 1700 hours causes a phase advance, while exposure outside this range results in a phase delay. In humans, the altering effects of blue-enriched light (such as those emitted from phone screens) appear to be stronger in the evenings and during the nighttime compared to the morning hours. Bright, continuous, blue light resets the SCN pacemakers which synchronizes the rhythms of subsidiary cellular clocks which would otherwise run free and go out of phase with each other and out of synchronism with the solar day [15].

Smartphones equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit visible blue light of short wavelength in the range of 446 to 484 nm. This screen light alters the circadian rhythms and also affects the ocular system: it reduces the melatonin hormone secretions (which is controlled by the SCN and the pineal gland) and decreases the core body temperature and the distal-proximal skin temperature (due to vasodilation of the distal blood vessels), leading to an increased level of sleepiness in the mornings and the evenings. Cortisol secretion by the pituitary gland is also influenced by the SCN. Normally there is a rapid increase in the blood cortisol level 30 to 60 minutes after awakening. One hour of exposure to mobile screen light of wavelength (414 to 800 lux) in dim light alters the cortisol awakening response. About 30 minutes of exposure to smartphone screen light with a frequency range of 0.50-3.99 Hz also reduces the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the brain, leading to mental disturbances, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety [16].

These findings have led to the effective use of light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual depression, bulimia, and circadian rhythm disorders related to sleep and dementia [17].

Public health importance

Sleep plays a crucial role in memory symbolization and integration, as noticed by researchers over a century ago. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have revealed several compelling findings. These findings indicate that sleep is essential for all the stages of learning. Sleep provides the ideal environment for neural network-level changes in memory representation and stabilizes the brain for long-term retention. Restorative sleep also prepares the brain for new learning [18]. 

These findings must be seen against the background of the widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone usage and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance [16]. Although no causative links have been shown to date, the International Agency for Research has identified some shift schedules that disrupt the circadian rhythms which serve as a potential carcinogen [19]. Melatonin suppression is also shown to be associated with diabetes mellitus type II [19].

A comparable study conducted in Japan aimed at evaluating the effects of mobile phone usage on sleep in adolescents. The results found that the increased phone use after turning off the lights before bed was linked to shorter sleep duration, poor sleep quality, insomnia, and greater daytime sleepiness [20]. This research highlighted the negative consequences of nighttime phone use on the overall sleep health of adolescents, emphasizing the importance of restricting screen time before sleep.

Multiple recent reviews found that adolescent mental health was significantly impacted by smartphone use. Chronic sleep deprivation leading to reduced cognitive ability/ school performance, social isolation, and self-harm was identified by multiple cross-sectional, longitudinal, and empirical studies in this population [21-23]. Associated comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and excessive alcohol intake were also identified in this population [24,25].

Conclusions

The review was able to flag critical and clinically relevant concerns of public health importance related to the continuous usage of smartphones. Research has proved that the use of smartphones could disrupt circadian rhythms leading to disturbances in lifestyle, sleep, and multiple cellular biological processes.

It is mandatory to impose screen time restrictions and document the levels of impairment related to sleep patterns, negative mood swings, and memory loss produced in the learning population and adolescents. Counseling students about the detrimental consequences of smartphone use before bedtime and the significance of getting sufficient sleep for the achievement of academic success is essential. Some researchers have already found that restriction of mobile phone use for 30 minutes before bedtime has a greater potential for improving sleep, overall mental health, and academic performance of students.

The clinical importance of evaluating smartphone usage patterns in the field of mental health and de-addiction is also highlighted in this clinically oriented review. Despite its many potential benefits, such as social connectivity, educational tools, and financial applications, smartphone addiction has been shown to negatively impact the overall health of adolescents.

These findings must be seen against the background of widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone use and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance. The implications of circadian disruption for learning populations, such as university students and professionals training for careers in medicine, and other critical occupations, cannot be overstated. This review highlights the possible negative consequences of smartphone use on overall sleep health while emphasizing the importance of studying its impact, on mental health and learning outcomes, in different populations.\xa0The review aimed to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and the consequences for their academic achievement. The method used was a comprehensive search strategy using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases with\xa0appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.\n\nKeywords: adolescents, learning, psychiatry & mental health, sleep pattern, smartphone usage\n\nIntroduction and background\n\nMobile phones are mass-produced electronic\xa0devices\xa0that are an integral part of our lives due to\xa0benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment, including games. They are popular, especially because\xa0they provide these\xa0benefits instantly, due to their portability and size [1].\n\nSmartphones, on\xa0the other hand,\xa0are\xa0technologically more advanced mobile devices, which can perform many of the\xa0functions of a computer, in addition to those of mobile phones, while having the same convenience and form factor.\xa0Given the multifaceted applications of a smartphone, it has also progressively become an intrinsic part of our lives and relationships.\xa0\n\nThe many benefits of a smartphone\xa0like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are, however, balanced by negative health consequences, including neck pain, accidents, poor mental health, and sleep disturbances [2]. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. A systematic review of Indian adolescents revealed that smartphone addiction among adolescents was 39% to 44% on average.\xa0Nearly 300 million of the Indian population uses smartphones [3]. Surveys suggest that up to 50% of teens and 27% of their parents feel that they may be addicted to mobile phones [4].\n\nThese negative health consequences are repeatedly highlighted by the popular press. However, it must\xa0be kept in mind that many of these negative health consequences of smartphone use are speculative and alarmist. Mental health professionals need to have actionable evidence to counsel their clients in a balanced and appropriate manner based on available scientific evidence [5-6].\xa0\n\nThe objective of this clinically oriented comprehensive review was to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and its consequences on their academic achievement. The methodology used was a comprehensive search strategy in Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases using appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.\n\nReview\n\nMethodology\n\nTo conduct this review, a comprehensive search was undertaken using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Keywords include “adolescents”, “psychiatry and mental health”, “learning”, “sleep pattern”, and "smartphone usage”. The search results were supplemented by reviewing the bibliographies of the articles found, ensuring a thorough exploration of the subject matter related to the influence of smartphone usage on sleep patterns, mental health, and the academic performance of adolescents.\xa0\n\nNegative aspects of widespread smartphone use\n\nPeople using smartphones have problems structuring their daily routines due to the disruptive impact of notifications and screen time. When it comes to students, sleep disturbances may in addition interfere with their ability to reach their classrooms, pay attention, and ability to focus and learn [7]. The result is an inefficient lifestyle with subpar academic outcomes, leading to stress and poor mental health.\xa0Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which\xa0are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially\xa0useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the impact of smartphone use on sleep. First, the bright light emitted suppresses the secretion of melatonin reducing sleep efficiency, delaying sleep onset, and disrupting circadian rhythms [7].\n\nSecond, sleep displacement occurs, when the smartphone is used as an unstructured leisure time activity with no predefined beginning and end point, unlike real-world games and other entertainment activities like attending theatrical performances, movies, and arcades [8].\n\nThird, sleep can be affected by the content consumed through the smartphone such as activating music, arousing sexual or violent images, and video games requiring hyper-alertness to anticipate the required responses. Not surprisingly, studies have found that\xa0mobile phone usage is associated with short sleep duration, reduced\xa0sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. There is also\xa0some evidence to suggest that this relationship may be bidirectional, especially in adults\xa0where insomnia may be the cause and not the outcome of mobile use [8].\n\nThe Millennium Cohort Survey containing 11,553 responses suggested later bedtime and shorter nighttime sleep duration\xa0are associated with hyperactivity and inattention. Indeed sleep deprivation was found to exert a modulatory effect on the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation and depression in adolescents [9].\n\nIn particular, bedtime smartphone use is predictive of later rising time, longer sleep latency, and worse sleep efficiency. The screen light emitted by mobile phones is of short wavelength and towards the blue length of the light spectrum, which is likely to delay sleep onset for a long duration after exposure. Therefore, screen time guidelines\xa0have been evolved for the various age groups specifically affected by smartphone addiction [10].\xa0According to the Australian Department of Health (ADH), the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the recommended screen time for\xa0adolescents should not exceed more than two hours per day [11].\xa0\n\nBiological aspects\n\nIn mammals, multiple physiological, endocrine, behavioral, and molecular rhythms are governed by an endogenous clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. It runs freely to a cycle of around 40 minutes and, therefore, needs to be re-synchronized\xa0with 24 hours per day.\xa0To reset this clock and synchronize it with the solar day, the SCN\xa0is entrained daily, by the dark-light cycle to which the organism is exposed [12].\n\nA phase shift in the circadian rhythms of the SCN results in alterations of both the bedtime and wake-up time of an individual which moves to a time earlier in the day (phase advance) or later in the day (phase delay). Light exposure suppresses the melatonin secretion and resets the\xa0phase of the SCN, which depends on the timing, intensity, wavelength, duration, and previous exposures to light or darkness. Light exposure, early in the biological night induces a phase delay while exposure late in the night and towards the early morning elicits a phase advance.\xa0Notably,\xa0these responses are\xa0present in blind people also,\xa0since the photoreceptors wired for the circadian entrainment are distinct from the rods and the cones of the visual system. These circadian photoreceptors have their peak sensitivity to a light wavelength\xa0in the range of 446 to 477 nm (visible short wavelength). Thus, a short wavelength approximately of 460 nm blue light exposure at night evokes a greater phase shift, thus alerting the responses and causing melatonin suppression when compared to other wavelength light in the visual range of 380 to 700 nm. Evidence indicates that these spectrally targeted blue light sources are more efficient in evoking circadian changes such as alertness, faster reaction time, attention lapses, and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while\xa0measuring the electrical activity of the brain [12].\n\nCircadian\xa0photoreceptors in the retina use melanopsin as photopigment. Along with these receptors, there are specialized ganglion cells that project directly to the SCN. Human circadian rhythms like those of other diurnal species are sensitive\xa0to light throughout the biological day. Indeed there is no part of the biological day where light exposure does not affect the circadian rhythms. However, there is a phase delay period\xa0in the early biological night and a phase\xa0advance region in the late biological night with the transition\xa0region occurring late in the biological night. These shifts are evident even with light exposure for a couple of days in a week [12].\xa0\n\nThe human circadian system is sensitive to even low-intensity light especially if it follows many hours of darkness. Most studies show that modern humans get relatively little bright light exposure and spend most of the day in indoor light with an intensity of 200 lux. Such individuals become sensitive to even modest light intensity of 1,000 lux. In addition, even brief flashes of light can be incorporated into the human circadian rhythm if they occur after dark periods. Supplementary to the regular sleep times with darkness during the day, studies have shown that intermittent exposure to bright light throughout the night causes the aligning of the circadian rhythms with the nightshift work schedules [13,14].\n\nThe physiological functions of human beings exhibit approximately a 24-hour rhythm. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the molecular mechanism regulating these rhythms. This molecular mechanism comprises genes that increase the transcription of other genes, whose products, in turn, exert a negative feedback, on their gene expression. This autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop is present in every cell of the body. These feedback loops affect many genes that sub-serve the functioning and the timing of cell biology. These individual cellular clocks are kept in synchrony by the neural network that connects them to the central circadian clock of the organism\xa0[13,14].\n\nIn addition to this genetic mechanism, there have been circadian rhythms noted even in non-nucleated cells such as red blood cells. These non-genetic mechanisms could interact with the gene transcription-translation loops in unknown ways. These mechanisms point to the existence of the primal circadian clock\xa0that could be common to all species. The ability of visible light to synchronize with\xa0the biological clock of the photosynthetic marine dinoflagellate (Gonyaulax polyedra) has been known since 1958 [13,14].\n\nHuman chronobiology\n\nThe SCN\xa0plays a critical role in regulating photoperiodic behavior and physiology such as sleep, wakefulness, alertness, feeding, hunting/ aggressions, seasonal reproduction, body temperature, and hibernation [15].\n\nA photoreceptive net\xa0consisting of the retinal ganglion cells and their axons (containing melanopsin), communicates directly with the brain influencing the circadian rhythms and the pupillary size, through projection to the SCN and the olivary pretectal nuclei, respectively. This photoreceptive system (as opposed to the functionally distinct visual system) encodes and transmits information about the ambient light intensity. Through this system, gross environmental illumination is integrated into the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neural behavioral systems of the human\xa0nervous system. Blue light appears to be the strongest synchronizing agent responsible for resetting the circadian rhythm, to keep the biological rhythms\xa0and the psycho-behavioral rhythms in phase with the solar day [14].\xa0In humans, bright blue light between 0500 and 1700 hours causes a phase advance, while exposure outside this range results in a phase delay. In humans, the altering effects of blue-enriched light (such as those emitted from phone screens) appear to be stronger in the evenings and during the nighttime compared to the morning hours. Bright, continuous, blue light\xa0resets the SCN pacemakers which synchronizes the rhythms of subsidiary cellular clocks which would otherwise run free and go out of phase with each other and out of synchronism with the solar day [15].\n\nSmartphones equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit visible blue light of short wavelength in the range of 446 to 484 nm.\xa0This screen light alters the circadian rhythms and also affects the ocular system: it reduces the melatonin hormone secretions (which is controlled by the SCN and the pineal gland) and decreases the core body temperature and the distal-proximal skin temperature (due to vasodilation of the distal blood vessels), leading to an increased level of sleepiness in the mornings and the evenings. Cortisol secretion by the pituitary gland is also influenced by the SCN. Normally there is a rapid increase in the blood cortisol level 30 to 60 minutes after awakening. One hour of exposure to mobile screen light of wavelength (414 to 800 lux) in dim light\xa0alters the cortisol awakening response. About 30 minutes of exposure to smartphone screen light with a frequency range of 0.50-3.99 Hz also reduces the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the brain, leading to mental disturbances, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety [16].\n\nThese findings have led to the effective use of light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual depression, bulimia, and circadian rhythm disorders related to sleep and dementia [17].\n\nPublic health importance\n\nSleep plays a crucial role in memory symbolization and integration, as noticed by\xa0researchers\xa0over a century ago. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have revealed several compelling findings. These findings indicate that sleep is essential for all the stages of learning. Sleep provides the ideal environment for neural network-level changes in memory representation and stabilizes the brain for long-term retention. Restorative sleep also prepares the brain for new learning [18].\xa0\n\nThese findings must be seen against the background of the widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone usage and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance [16]. Although no causative links have been shown to date, the International Agency for Research has identified some\xa0shift schedules\xa0that disrupt the\xa0circadian rhythms which serve as a\xa0potential carcinogen [19]. Melatonin suppression is also shown to be associated with diabetes mellitus type II [19].\n\nA comparable study conducted in Japan aimed at evaluating the effects of mobile phone usage on sleep in adolescents. The results found that the increased phone use after turning off the lights before bed was linked to shorter sleep duration, poor\xa0sleep quality, insomnia, and greater daytime sleepiness [20]. This research highlighted the negative consequences of nighttime phone use on the overall sleep health of adolescents, emphasizing the importance of restricting screen time before sleep.\n\nMultiple recent reviews found that adolescent mental health was significantly impacted by smartphone use. Chronic sleep deprivation leading to reduced cognitive ability/ school performance, social isolation, and self-harm was identified by multiple cross-sectional, longitudinal, and empirical studies in this population [21-23]. Associated comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and excessive alcohol intake were also identified in this population [24,25].\n\nConclusions\n\nThe review was able to flag critical and clinically relevant concerns\xa0of public health importance related to the continuous usage of smartphones. Research has proved that the use of smartphones could disrupt circadian rhythms leading to disturbances in lifestyle, sleep, and multiple cellular biological processes.\n\nIt is mandatory to impose screen time restrictions and document the levels of impairment related to sleep patterns, negative mood swings, and memory loss produced in the learning population and adolescents. Counseling students about the detrimental consequences of smartphone use before bedtime and the significance of getting sufficient sleep for the achievement of academic success is essential. Some researchers have already found that restriction of mobile phone use for 30 minutes before bedtime\xa0has a greater potential for improving sleep, overall mental health, and academic performance of students.\n\nThe clinical importance of evaluating smartphone usage patterns in the field of mental health and de-addiction is also highlighted in this clinically oriented review. Despite its many potential benefits, such as social connectivity, educational tools, and financial applications, smartphone addiction has been shown to negatively impact the overall health of adolescents.\n\nDisclosures\n\nConflicts of interest: In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:\n\nPayment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\nFinancial relationships: All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\nOther relationships: All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConcept and design:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nDrafting of the manuscript:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nCritical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nSupervision:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nReferences\n1.Smartphone addiction among university students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Abstract

(1) Background: Sleep is considered to be a complex condition for human beings, with the aim of ensuring physical and psychological recovery. Technology, including the cell phone, is a tool for teenagers that ensures they are always available to interact, even at night. This study aims to understand the influence of the use of smartphones on adolescent sleep quality. (2) Methods: The guidelines proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed. The search was conducted in October 2022 through the EBSCOhost platform, with access to the CINAHL Complete and Medline databases and through the b-On database. (3) Results: The use of electronic equipment plays an important role in adolescents’ lives. There is a negative relationship between the use of electronic equipment, such as smartphones, and sleep, for reducing both the quality and quantity of sleep. There is also a relationship between nighttime smartphone use, insufficient sleep, and mental health problems. (4) Conclusions: The use of new technologies at night causes a change in the behavior of adolescents with repercussions in terms of the quality of sleep and sleep duration and consequent well-being and performance during the day.

Keywords: smartphone, children, well-being, sleep, teenagers, media

1. Introduction

Sleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].

In a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).

The circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].

As it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.

The World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.

For good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.

Nowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].

This permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).

The Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.

Considering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.

2. Materials and Methods

A Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).

Using the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”

The search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.

The articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.

Among the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.

All articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.

Regarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.

All studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.

The analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].

Johansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.

In fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

4. Discussion

Adolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].

Technological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].

Schweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

The constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.

If, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.

The high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.

In fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.

The studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.

Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.

According to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].

Many authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.

In Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).

Meeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).

This study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.

Therefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.

Nursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).

Johansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].

In this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].

It is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.

5. Conclusions

It was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.

The influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.

It becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.

Based on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.

6. Limitations/Future Prospects

Limitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.

Technology, including the cell phone, is a tool for teenagers that ensures they are always available to interact, even at night. This study aims to understand the influence of the use of smartphones on adolescent sleep quality. (2) Methods: The guidelines proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed. The search was conducted in October 2022 through the EBSCOhost platform, with access to the CINAHL Complete and Medline databases and through the b-On database. (3) Results: The use of electronic equipment plays an important role in adolescents’ lives. There is a negative relationship between the use of electronic equipment, such as smartphones, and sleep, for reducing both the quality and quantity of sleep. There is also a relationship between nighttime smartphone use, insufficient sleep, and mental health problems. (4) Conclusions: The use of new technologies at night causes a change in the behavior of adolescents with repercussions in terms of the quality of sleep and sleep duration and consequent well-being and performance during the day.\n\nKeywords: smartphone, children, well-being, sleep, teenagers, media\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].\n\nIn a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).\n\nThe circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].\n\nAs it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.\n\nThe World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.\n\nFor good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.\n\nNowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].\n\nThis permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).\n\nThe Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.\n\nConsidering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nA Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).\n\nUsing the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”\n\nThe search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.\n\nThe articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.\n\nAmong the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nPRISMA of study selection and inclusion process [10].\n\nAfter the selection of studies, they were evaluated critically by applying assessment grids of the level of evidence, reliability, and relevance, which allowed us to classify the studies found (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.\n\nCritical evaluation of the results of the included studies according to the critical evaluation verification list by Joanna Briggs Institute [11].\n\nArticles\tQ1\tQ2\tQ3\tQ4\tQ5\tQ6\tQ7\tQ8\tQ9\tQ10\tResult\nTavernier et al.

One month after, the students were visited a second time and completed the same questionnaire.\nOpen in a new tab\n\nAll articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.\n\nRegarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.\n\nAll studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.\n\nThe analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].\n\nJohansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.\n\nIn fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nLikewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAdolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].\n\nTechnological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].\n\nSchweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nThe constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.\n\nIf, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.\n\nThe high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.\n\nIn fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.\n\nThe studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.\n\nLike these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.\n\nAccording to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].\n\nMany authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.\n\nIn Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).\n\nMeeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).\n\nThis study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.\n\nTherefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.\n\nNursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).\n\nJohansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].\n\nIn this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].\n\nIt is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIt was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.\n\nThe influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.\n\nIt becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.\n\nBased on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.\n\n6. Limitations/Future Prospects\n\nLimitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.d.C.M. and M.C.; methodology, S.d.S., A.B. and M.C.; software, M.J.R. and H.M.; validation, H.M., S.D. and M.J.R.; formal analysis, S.d.S.; investigation, M.J.R. and S.D.; resources, S.d.S. and A.B.; data curation, M.d.C.M.; writing—original draft preparation, S.d.S. and A.B.; writing—review and editing, M.J.R.; visualization, S.D.; supervision, M.C.; project administration, S.d.S. and M.d.C.M.

Summary

With the widespread use of portable electronic devices and the normalization of screen media devices in the bedroom, insufficient sleep has become commonplace, affecting 30% of toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children and the majority of adolescents.1,2 In a recent literature review of studies investigating the link between youth screen media use and sleep, 90% of included studies found an association between screen media use and delayed bedtime and/or decreased total sleep time.3 Proposed mechanisms include displacement of time that would have been spent sleeping, psychological stimulation and light exposure, and increased physiological alertness.3 This pervasive phenomenon of pediatric sleep loss has widespread implications due to the associations between insufficient sleep and increased risk of childhood obesity 4, disrupted psychological well-being 5 and impaired cognitive/academic functioning6. There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep loss and health consequences in children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth themselves to foster healthy sleep habits.

Introduction

The widespread use of portable electronic devices and the normalization of screen media devices in the bedroom is accompanied by a high prevalence of insufficient sleep, affecting a majority of adolescents, and 30% of toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children.1,2 Three-fourths of American children and adolescents report the presence of at least one screen-media device in their bedroom, with roughly 60% reporting regular use of these devices during the hour before bedtime.7,8

Parents, educators, and clinicians express concern about whether excessive use of screen media among young people affects sleep and wellbeing. In this article, we provide an overview of the current science on screens and sleep, with a focus on recommendations to reduce the potentially problematic influence of screen time on pediatric sleep. We then review how impaired sleep in pediatric populations may lead to a range of adverse behaviors, physical health problems and well-being outcomes. We begin with a summary of the two consensus statements on child and adolescent sleep needs. Then we summarize the range of screen habits among youth, focusing on screen habits at bedtime. Next, we review current literature on evidence of the effects of youth screen habits on sleep, and the mechanisms by which screen habits may impact sleep. We conclude with evidence-based strategies to improve sleep through sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations and other take-home messages for families and practitioners.

Sleep requirements for children and adolescents

Two independent sleep associations – the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) – each convened teams of sleep researchers and other experts to establish consensuses to guide health care providers and the public about sleep duration requirements across the lifespan, based on the best available evidence. Both groups used a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method9 to arrive at their recommendations. For the pediatric population, the NSF panel recommended that newborns (0–3 months) obtain 14–17 hours of sleep daily, infants (4–11 months) obtain 12–15 hours, toddlers (1–2 years) obtain 11–14 hours, preschoolers (3–5 years) obtain 10–13 hours, school-aged children (6–13 years) obtain 9–11 hours, and teenagers (14–17 years) obtain 8–10 hours.10 The AASM recommendations were identical to those of the NSF, except the former suggested that infants aged 4–12 months obtain 12–16 hours of sleep per day (including naps) and children aged 6–12 obtain 9–12 hours.11

Consequences of insufficient sleep for cognitive, psychological and physical wellbeing

Sleep problems in early life predict a greater likelihood of later development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence.12 In a large study (N= 32,662), short sleep duration (≤ 10h/night by maternal report) and nocturnal awakenings (≥ 3/night) in toddlers were associated with development of behavioral and emotional problems at age 5.13 Sleep problems at age 4 have been found to predict a greater incidence of behavioral and emotional problems emerging by mid-adolescence.14 In experimental studies, toddler napping appears to be important for self-regulation. A challenging puzzle task following 5 days of regular napping (compared to non-napping) elicited fewer perseverative behaviors, and less negative self-appraisals.15 Imposing sleep restriction on healthy teens rapidly degrades mood and emotion regulation16, as with adults. A large cross-sectional study of adolescents identified associations between short sleep duration and emotional problems, peer conflict, and suicidal ideation.17 In a meta-analysis of longitudinal and intervention studies, adolescent sleep problems appear to precede the emergence of depression.18 Although more work on the modifiable aspects of sleep duration, sleep quality, and regularity of sleep timing are needed, current literature suggests that each of these factors is important for psychological health. These relationships may be bi-directional, as sleep and psychological problems influence one another throughout development,19 suggesting a resonance phenomenon or a vicious cycle that may be exacerbated by excessive screen media habits. Williams and colleagues have proposed a Developmental Cascade Model, supported by longitudinal data on children, to explain the reciprocal interactions of sleep and emotion and attention self-regulation.20

Beyond emotional and behavioral problems, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies revealed that short sleep duration was reliably associated with weight gain, adiposity, and obesity risk in both children and adults.4 Infants obtaining less than 12 hours of sleep/day, measured by maternal report, were more likely to be overweight at age 3 and have higher levels of adiposity.21 In a longitudinal study of children age 1 to age 7, sleep duration was associated with greater BMI increases, fat mass, and waist-to-hip ratio.22 In a controlled, laboratory-based experimental study, 3-year old children exposed to acute sleep restriction (skipping a nap and bedtime delayed ~2.3 hours) consumed greater amounts of carbohydrate and fat and more total calories23, which may explain the elevated risk of obesity caused by insufficient sleep. A recent review identified sleep as among the socioeconomic, family, environmental, and behavioral factors contributing to childhood obesity.24

In a longitudinal study of children in 3rd grade, bedtimes after 8pm were associated with greater odds of increased adiposity measured at 6th grade. As with children, insufficient sleep in adolescence has been shown to promote dietary behaviors that lead to obesity25, with additional effects mediated via decreased physical activity and neuroendocrine changes that bolster fat storage. More evidence is needed, particularly in interventions that counteract the effects of screen-media consumption leading to insufficient quantity or inadequate quality sleep, that in turn influence weight gain in childhood. However, the “weight” of available evidence suggests that obesity may be a sleep loss-related outcome of excessive screen-media consumption.

What are the bedtime screen habits of infants, children, and adolescents?

Although the scientific and clinical communities continue to express concern regarding the negative impacts of screen media on sleep, electronics in the bedroom and screen time use around bedtime remain common among youth.26–28 A large-scale, nationally representative sample of American parents in 201326 revealed that about one third (36%) of young children had TVs in their bedrooms, including 16% of children under 2 years of age, 37% of 2- to 4-year-olds, and 45% of 5- to 8-year-olds. Additionally, among parents of infants and young children who allowed a bedroom TV, 22% did so to help their child fall asleep, 14% did so to get their child to fall asleep in his/her own room, and 4% did so because their child slept in a family room containing a TV.26 The presence of a TV in the bedroom varies by cultural, socioeconomic and structural factors. Data from a 2016 nationally representative study of over 2,600 US youth indicated that 47% of tweens and 57% of teens have TVs in their bedrooms.27 Media devices in the bedroom were more common in lower-income youth (68% versus 37%). The authors speculated that the higher rate of media in the bedrooms of lower-income tweens and teens may be the result of more frequent room sharing, sleeping in a multi-purposed room, or differing family preferences. Parent-report data from the 2014 Sleep in America poll by the NSF revealed that 75% of youth keep at least one type of electronic device in their bedroom. The poll also found that the 28% of school-aged children and 57% of teenagers who leave an electronic device on in their bedroom after bedtime obtained less total sleep and had lower sleep quality.7

About 50% of parents endorse the belief that watching TV helps their infant, toddler, or preschooler ‘wind down’ in the evening.28 Likewise, multiple studies documented that adolescents report using media at bedtime to “help” them fall asleep.29 There is a current programming trend toward developing calming shows and apps aimed at helping children relax before bedtime and transition to sleep. To our knowledge, no published research exists on the effectiveness of such content. Such evidence should be a minimum requirement for these approaches to be recommended.

Importantly, over the past decade, the landscape of screen media devices has changed markedly, dramatically altering children and adolescents engage with their environment. Data from large national US samples in 2011 and 2013 show an increase in ownership of tablet devices in young children (age 0–8) from 8% to 40% and an increase in access to mobile “smart” devices at home from 52% to 75%.26 Another report indicated that, from 2011 to 2013, the percentage of children under 2 years of age who had used a mobile device rose from 10% to 38%.26

Screen media, especially near bedtime, is adversely associated with sleep time and quantity

In relation to a growing interest in the association between screen time and sleep patterns, data from over 60 associated studies have been examined in two systematic literature reviews3,30 and two related meta-analyses31,32. In the time since those articles were published, at least a dozen more studies have surfaced (e.g., see6,8,33–42), from a wide-range of cultural contexts including Thailand,37 Saudi Arabia,40 and Norway.8

The vast majority of these studies indicate that the extent of screen time among children and adolescents is associated with delayed bedtime and shorter total sleep time 43–45. Several studies also found associations between screen time and reduced sleep quality,46,47 longer sleep onset latency,48 and increased daytime tiredness.49,50 One recent study found that electronic media use accounted for 30% of all variance in adolescent sleep efficiency, as measured by actigraphy.34 Most studies examined total daily screen time as a predictor, but even greater effects on sleep have been documented in evening media use in the bedroom (i.e., in the 1–2 hours before bedtime51,52) and in use of violent media at any time.53,54

One meta-analysis investigated the association between portable screen-based media devices and sleep outcomes.32 Merging results from 20 studies and over 125,000 youth, the authors consistently found that bedtime media usage is associated with insufficient sleep duration (OR=2.17, p<.001), poor sleep quality (OR=1.46, p<.01) and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR=2.72, p<0.01). This meta-analysis found that the mere presence of a portable screen-based media device in the bedroom has adverse associations with sleep outcomes. In one study of 600 preschoolers, those with a TV in their bedroom watched twice as much evening TV (about 28 versus 13 minutes, respectively) and watched more shows with violent/scary or ‘mature’ content (29% versus 13%).53 Most related studies focused on typically-developing children, but results of studies on children with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorders show similar patterns. One such study found that exposure to violent programming within 30 minutes before bedtime was associated with longer sleep latency and shorter sleep duration.54

Negative associations with sleep have been found with use of a range of screen media devices, including television, computers, video games, and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.29,51,52,55–65 However, there are mixed results regarding whether the type, size, or interactivity level of the screen affects sleep outcomes. In a study of 2,048 children in grades four and seven, having either a TV or small screen device near where they sleep – as well as more daily screen time– was associated with obtaining less sleep.6 The rise in interactive media options may increase the impact of media use on sleep, as some studies have found that interactive screen media use (e.g. video games and mobile devices) may have a greater impact on sleep than passive use, such as watching television.6,45,66–71 One recent meta-analysis found no association between television watching and sleep duration,31 but did find that computer use is associated with shorter total sleep duration. Another study shows that use of interactive screen-media increases the odds of nighttime awakenings and daytime tiredness,41 but other studies examining the effects of video game use on sleep have shown more modest effects.68,72 One study compared 1 hour of bedtime tablet use with three different lighting profiles and found minimal differences in the impact on sleep and next-day functioning.73 However, longer durations of bright screen use (between 1.5–5 hours) have shown to increase alertness before sleep.74–77

Mechanisms through which screens affect sleep

Since many of the existing studies are observational and cross-sectional, causality is difficult to discern. Several potential mechanisms, along with supporting evidence, are briefly discussed below: time displacement, psychological stimulation from content, and the alerting and circadian effects of light.

Time displacement of sleep

Screen media use can lead to behavioral bedtime delay, as children or adolescents postpone bedtime to prolong screen entertainment.66,78,79 Using a screen-based device displaces time that would otherwise have been spent sleeping. This time-displacement mechanism is particularly powerful when screens are used at night, when sleep is most likely the activity being directly offset.

Psychological stimulation from media content disrupting sleep

Research has found mixed results regarding the effect of screen media use on psychological, emotional, and/or physiological arousal, but this relationship likely mediates some effect of screen media use on sleep.80–83 Video games, particularly violent games, are often thrilling for enthusiasts, typically simulating life-or-death experiences requiring players’ full attention to succeed. Violent videogame play before bed increase arousal compared to nonviolent gameplay. However, arousal is a likely mediator of sleep problems even in non-violent media use.46 In another controlled experiment, playing an “exciting” video game was associated with increased heart rate, slightly delayed sleep-onset, and decreased REM sleep, further suggesting that the effect of screen use on sleep is mediated via arousal.61

Effects of light-emitting screens on child and adolescent sleep

Exposure to the light emitted by screens in the evening hours before and/or during bedtime is another likely mechanism by which use of screen media negatively impacts sleep. Screen-based light may affect sleep via several pathways:

increasing arousal and reducing sleepiness at bedtime,

disrupting sleep architecture as assessed by polysomnographic (PSG) recording, and

delaying the circadian rhythm and subsequently postponing sleep-onset, which results in shortened sleep duration unless wake-time is also delayed.

Studies of young adults demonstrated that evening use of light-emitting devices increases alertness and decreases sleepiness before bedtime, as determined by cognitive performance, self-reported scales and waking EEG measures.74,76,84 These studies also showed that this light suppresses blood levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which normally increases in the hours before bedtime.74,76,77,84 Similar results were found in an experimental study of adolescents, in which exposure to LED screens before bedtime decreased self-reported sleepiness and melatonin levels.75 Exposure to non-screen artificial light in the evening also increases alertness (quelling underlying sleep drive) and suppresses melatonin levels, delaying sleep onset. The light emitted from screen media devices includes greater short-wavelength light in the blue light range, which has been shown to induce stronger melatonin-suppressing responses 85. In fact, in the aforementioned study of adolescents75, both subjective alertness and melatonin suppression were significantly attenuated when study participants wore glasses that filtered out short-wavelength light.

Few studies have directly measured the effects of light from screens on polysomnographic (PSG) measures of sleep.73,75,76 One such study in young adults found that exposure to light-emitting devices before bedtime caused a phase delay of melatonin release and modestly increased the time to fall asleep and reduced the duration of REM sleep76. It is impossible to determine whether longer sleep latency or reduced REM sleep duration was due to decreased sleepiness before bedtime, suppression of melatonin, a phase delay of the circadian clock, or a combination of these factors. Other published reports, including a study of adolescents,73 found no significant changes on subsequent PSG with evening exposure to light-emitting devices.73,75

Although limited research documents the effects of light from digital media on sleep, the results are particularly applicable to youth, who may be more sensitive to light than adults.86 One study 87 found that the magnitude of melatonin suppression induced by moderately bright indoor light levels in the evening was twice as much in primary school children as in adults. This difference could be related to pupil diameter, which is significantly larger in children than adults. Another study88 found that children showed significantly greater melatonin suppression compared to adolescents in response to varying degrees of evening light exposure. Taken together, these results suggest that the light from screen media use around bedtime adversely affects sleep, particularly in younger children. Furthermore, these findings indicate the need for further research on the effect of screen media devices on sleep, especially in youth.

Internet and video game addiction and sleep

There is growing concern that technology habits can become uncontrollable and excessive to the point of interference with normal daily functioning. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V (DSM-V) recognizes one type of technology addiction, internet gaming disorder, as a “condition for further study”.89 More broadly, the concept of internet and video game addiction (IVGA), has gained traction in the psychological and psychiatric communities, due in part to the disorder’s deleterious effects on sleep. IVGA is classified as an inability of internet users to limit excessive internet use, with ensuing psychosocial dysfunction.90 A recent systematic literature review and other studies show a particularly strong association between use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and poor sleep quality.91–93 IVGA has been associated with subjective insomnia and insufficient sleep among afflicted adolescents.91 Existing literature on this association remains limited and causality is unproven, but there appears to be a strong association between IVGA and sleep problems.

Moderating factors

New evidence suggests some young people are particularly susceptible to the ill effects of screen media on sleep quality. As early as 2009, researchers documented individual differences in teenagers’ heart rate variability (HRV) when playing violent video games.83 A subsequent study46 demonstrated that adolescents’ level of gaming experience moderated the effect between their videogame use, HRV, and sleep. Inexperienced gamers reported poorer sleep after playing a violent video game, in contrast to experienced gamers who reported poorer sleep after a nonviolent videogame. Physiological trait differences can also amplify technology exposure effects by directly delaying bedtimes.52 An experimental laboratory study by Reynolds and colleagues79 revealed that adolescents who perceived fewer consequences from risk-taking were more likely to end daily video gaming sessions at a later time, thus delaying sleep onset, compared with their peers. Smith et al.94 found that adolescents who self-reported higher trait flow (the ability to easily immerse oneself into an activity) were also more likely to delay bedtime via extended periods of evening gaming. Their follow-up laboratory study replicated this effect, but only for videogames that were both challenging and enjoyable (i.e. when game difficulty was set to “hard” instead of “easy”). Similarly, poor self-control in combination with unstructured television viewing has been associated with delayed bedtimes in adults, a finding supported in a follow-up study.95 This emerging research suggests that identifying predisposing individual traits and characteristics of the technology use helps discern youth whose technology habits are most likely to delay sleep onset.

Interventions, policies and strategies designed to improve child and adolescent sleep

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a Statement of Endorsement in support of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines, which recommends that screen-based devices not be allowed in children’s bedrooms and be turned off 30 minutes before bedtime.96 These are commonly suggested approaches, but modifying media content may be another effective means of protecting sleep. A randomized trial found that a harm-reduction intervention, which attempted to change the media exposure of preschool children away from violent and towards educational and prosocial content, significantly decreased odds of sleep problems across follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 months, compared with controls.97

Experimental studies seeking to evaluate interventions to improve sleep outcomes in children and adolescents are sparse, and have typically incorporated multifaceted sleep hygiene programs that address multiple elements in addition to screen media before bed. Nevertheless, existing literature suggests that limiting screen time during the 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime may yield modest benefits in terms of “lights out time” as well as sleep quality and duration. A one-week program, consisting of classes teaching sleep physiology, biological significance, and consequences of sleep deprivation, resulted in more regular bedtimes and shorter sleep-onset latency among 58 adolescents (mean 16 years old), but no benefit on sleep quality or daytime sleepiness.98 Another investigation assessed the utility the FERRET (Food, Emotions, Routine, Restrict, Environment and Timing) sleep hygiene program among 22 adolescents (mean 13 years old). FERRET instructed adolescents to comply with three rules for each of the domains of the acronym (e.g. Restrict: No electronic media at least 30 minutes before bed, no exercise 3 hours before bed, no other activities in bed except for sleep).99 This program significantly improved scores on the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), although objective sleep duration did not change significantly. A targeted intervention of mobile phone restriction in the hour before bed among 63 adolescents (mean 16 years old) resulted in “lights out” 17 minutes earlier and a total sleep time increase of 19 minutes per night.100 However, the authors reported a low 26% recruitment rate, highlighting the difficulty of implementing such a regimented screen-limiting schedule in teens. In another study, limiting screen media around bedtime for healthy adolescents with good sleep did not significantly impact sleep outcomes. In a study of high school athletes (mean 17 years) whose baseline consisted of sufficient sleep (e.g. total sleep time, 7:49 weekdays, 9:11 weekends), a strict “no electronic media” rule after 10:00 pm resulted in no benefit in terms of total sleep time, sleep quality, or daytime functioning.101 In sum, limited existing research suggests that sleep hygiene interventions may be practically challenging to achieve but yield benefits to those children and adolescents with insufficent sleep. Larger, multi-site studies are urgently needed given the increasing intrusion of evening screen media use in of the lives of modern youth, including gaming, social media, and homework.

Clinician’s perspective

Clinicians can help families improve their sleep health and screen media habits by encouraging parenting marked by high levels of warmth and support, as well as limits that are clearly communicated, consistently applied appropriate to the child’s behavior and context, and allow for developmentally appropriate autonomy(i.e. an authoritative parenting style). 102,103 (See Box 1) All parents should begin instilling family bedtime routines and healthy sleep habits early in life, and adjust these routines as youth mature (See Box 2). If the youth health behaviors and habits become part of the child’s own daily routine, she will be better able to take charge of her own sleep health behaviors when this becomes appropriate in later years. For younger children, these routines mean establishing household rules related to screens and sleep early on. For older children and adolescents, they involve open conversation about the core reasons for behaviors. This proactive and engaged parenting style promotes cooperation and parent-child shared goals for children’s health and well-being, and aims to help children develop self-regulation skills, and eventually increasing autonomy to govern their own behavior.

Avoid screen media in the hour before bedtime and at nighttime.

Replace evening screen time with calm activities for your children (reading, coloring, conversation, etc.).

Keep all screen devices (TVs, video games, computers, tablets, and smartphones) out of bedrooms.

Avoid passive background media: Children may be affected by screen media even when they are not actively engaged.

Content matters: Avoid violent and/or scary media, which can negatively affect your children’s sleep.

Family rules/routines are most effective when applied to all children in the household.

Establish other healthy sleep practices for your child and yourself.112,114,115

Set and abide by regular bedtimes every day, including weekends, allowing the child sufficient sleep duration for his/her age.10

Bedtime should follow a predictable routine (e.g.: brush teeth, read a story, lights out).

Bedrooms should be cool (65–70 degrees), comfortable, dark, and quiet.

Avoid evening intake of chocolate or beverages that interfere with sleep (soda, tea, coffee, energy drinks).

Include physical exercise into the daily routine, and spend time outdoors during sunlight hours when possible.

Be a healthy sleep role model by prioritizing your own sleep.

Improve your own sleep-related behaviors (e.g., reduce screen time before bedtime, establish a regular bedtime, etc.)114 to improve your health and well-being116

Turn off electronic media devices in the evening throughout the household and charge all mobile devices in a central location outside bedrooms.

Parents who are overtired are less well able to parent effectively, including being proactive in orchestrating child routines and dealing effectively and calmly with daily hassles that are part of everyday life.

Parent your child with clear communication, awareness, and fair, consistent, developmentally appropriate rules.117

Talk with your child or teen early and often about the importance of adequate sleep for optimal health.

Be aware of how much time your child or teen spends engaging in screen media, including before and after bedtime.76

Pay attention to your child or teen’s mood and behavior at home, and discuss concerns you may have. Mood impairment is often caused by inadequate sleep.

Establish and enforce appropriate media and sleep rules for your children as early in their lives as possible; consistently point out after-effects of failing to follow those rules (e.g., being tired and cranky the next day after playing games too late) to develop your child’s understanding of the effects of inadequate sleep.

Work with teens to jointly develop healthy sleep routines that also allow them to meet obligations (e.g., homework or sports) and are consistent with the guidelines above. Developing autonomy and ability to self-regulate is important for teens, as is consistency.

Examples from health psychology provide accessible guidance. A teen with a healthy diet does not typically result from the rigid imposition of a such a diet after a lifetime of unhealthy foods, but with a healthy and balanced eating habits instilled from a young age. A healthy “screen media diet” may be a resonant and useful concept for many children, parents, educators, and clinicians. It is difficult for parents who smoke to mandate a no-smoking policy. Role modeling and a health-risk prevention approach is far more likely to be effective than a secondary prevention approach (e.g smoking cessation). Successful parenting ideally starts early and sets appropriate norms and boundaries while maintaining parental warmth, rather than holding off on setting boundaries until a problem develops requiring discipline. Encouraging the development of age-appropriate autonomy will help teenagers to develop a sense of responsibility for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

For teenagers presenting with excessive screen time, a few clinical pearls may help families to follow the recommendations laid out in Box 1 and 2, below. First, one must always focus on the chief complaint, what brought the patient to seek help in the first place. In cases of excessive nighttime screen media use, children and adolescents are often seen in the clinician’s office for poor academic performance or lack of concentration in school. Upon taking a careful history, the clinician often discovers a significant lack of sleep, often attributable to patients staying up late while using mobile devices, computers, or videogames. Clinicians must discover the underlying factors (e.g., social or family stress) which drive the patient to use the screens in the late hours. Addressing such factors directly may be essential to motivating families to achieve healthier screen habits.

The clinicians should then work with families to reduce evening and nighttime screen media use via structural and behavioral modifications in order to improve sleep health (See Box 2). Many adolescents are reluctant to change their health behaviors,104 yet providing them with education about the positive benefits of sufficient sleep as well as the negative consequences of poor sleep can help motivate such change.105–109 For example, pointing out that a change in sleep habits may improve concentration, daytime alertness, and academic performance may motivate youth to modify nighttime habits. Discussing the negative repercussions of inadequate sleep on qualities that are important to the patient, such as body weight or athletic performance, may likewise motivate the patient to reduce nighttime screen media use and establish other healthy bedtime habits. Perhaps most importantly, parents and children should remove screen-based devices from the bedroom to ensure that they are not used at night.

Changing bedtime screen media use habits in our young patients is challenging. However, several tools and strategies increase our chances of success, with the goal of promoting healthy sleep habits that children and adolescents will continue to follow throughout their lives.

Recommendations for clinicians, educators, and parents

Based on our current understanding of clinical practice and sleep health research, we have developed sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for clinicians and educators (see Box 1) and for parents (see Box 2) to help minimize the adverse effects of screen-based media on the sleep of children and adolescents.

Future directions

Research indicates that screen-based media represents a threat to the sleep quality of youth, many of whom already have insufficient sleep. However, very few studies demonstrate easy-to-implement and effective interventions. Future research should develop, implement, and evaluate sustainable interventions that minimize the adverse effects of evening screen use on sleep. For example, a means of reducing fear of missing out from social media and other screen-based activities may significantly improve the sleep of adolescents.110,111 There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research into the effects of screen-based media on sleep and related health consequences among children and adolescents, in order to educate and motivate parents, clinicians, teachers, and youth to foster healthy sleep habits.

Key points.

Use of screen media by youth, throughout the day and in the period before bedtime, is associated with shorter total sleep time and delayed sleep onset in over five dozen studies from around the world. Access to a screen-media device in the bedroom at night is associated with shorter sleep duration, later bedtime, and poorer sleep quality.

The currently-supported mechanisms underlying the relationship between screen media habits and sleep outcomes include (1) displacement of time spent sleeping by time spent using screens, (2) psychological stimulation from screen-media content, and (3) alerting and circadian effects of exposure to light from screens.

Clinicians, educators, and parents should prioritize the need of youth to get sufficient sleep through maintaining regular and consistent bedtime routines. In addition, youth and parents should practice sleep-friendly screen behaviors: restricting exposure to digital media in the hour before bedtime, turning devices off during the night, and keeping devices out of bedrooms. Modifying media content to reduce psychological stimulation (e.g., limiting violent or scary media) may also reduce adverse impact on sleep.

There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep and related health and health behavior consequences among children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth to maintain healthy sleep habits.

There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep loss and health consequences in children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth themselves to foster healthy sleep habits.\n\nKeywords: youth, screen media habits, sleep, screen-behavior recommendations\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe widespread use of portable electronic devices and the normalization of screen media devices in the bedroom is accompanied by a high prevalence of insufficient sleep, affecting a majority of adolescents, and 30% of toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children.1,2 Three-fourths of American children and adolescents report the presence of at least one screen-media device in their bedroom, with roughly 60% reporting regular use of these devices during the hour before bedtime.7,8\n\nParents, educators, and clinicians express concern about whether excessive use of screen media among young people affects sleep and wellbeing. In this article, we provide an overview of the current science on screens and sleep, with a focus on recommendations to reduce the potentially problematic influence of screen time on pediatric sleep. We then review how impaired sleep in pediatric populations may lead to a range of adverse behaviors, physical health problems and well-being outcomes. We begin with a summary of the two consensus statements on child and adolescent sleep needs. Then we summarize the range of screen habits among youth, focusing on screen habits at bedtime. Next, we review current literature on evidence of the effects of youth screen habits on sleep, and the mechanisms by which screen habits may impact sleep. We conclude with evidence-based strategies to improve sleep through sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations and other take-home messages for families and practitioners.\n\nSleep requirements for children and adolescents\n\nTwo independent sleep associations – the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) – each convened teams of sleep researchers and other experts to establish consensuses to guide health care providers and the public about sleep duration requirements across the lifespan, based on the best available evidence. Both groups used a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method9 to arrive at their recommendations. For the pediatric population, the NSF panel recommended that newborns (0–3 months) obtain 14–17 hours of sleep daily, infants (4–11 months) obtain 12–15 hours, toddlers (1–2 years) obtain 11–14 hours, preschoolers (3–5 years) obtain 10–13 hours, school-aged children (6–13 years) obtain 9–11 hours, and teenagers (14–17 years) obtain 8–10 hours.10 The AASM recommendations were identical to those of the NSF, except the former suggested that infants aged 4–12 months obtain 12–16 hours of sleep per day (including naps) and children aged 6–12 obtain 9–12 hours.11\n\nConsequences of insufficient sleep for cognitive, psychological and physical wellbeing\n\nSleep problems in early life predict a greater likelihood of later development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence.12 In a large study (N= 32,662), short sleep duration (≤ 10h/night by maternal report) and nocturnal awakenings (≥ 3/night) in toddlers were associated with development of behavioral and emotional problems at age 5.13 Sleep problems at age 4 have been found to predict a greater incidence of behavioral and emotional problems emerging by mid-adolescence.14 In experimental studies, toddler napping appears to be important for self-regulation. A challenging puzzle task following 5 days of regular napping (compared to non-napping) elicited fewer perseverative behaviors, and less negative self-appraisals.15 Imposing sleep restriction on healthy teens rapidly degrades mood and emotion regulation16, as with adults. A large cross-sectional study of adolescents identified associations between short sleep duration and emotional problems, peer conflict, and suicidal ideation.17 In a meta-analysis of longitudinal and intervention studies, adolescent sleep problems appear to precede the emergence of depression.18 Although more work on the modifiable aspects of sleep duration, sleep quality, and regularity of sleep timing are needed, current literature suggests that each of these factors is important for psychological health. These relationships may be bi-directional, as sleep and psychological problems influence one another throughout development,19 suggesting a resonance phenomenon or a vicious cycle that may be exacerbated by excessive screen media habits. Williams and colleagues have proposed a Developmental Cascade Model, supported by longitudinal data on children, to explain the reciprocal interactions of sleep and emotion and attention self-regulation.20\n\nBeyond emotional and behavioral problems, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies revealed that short sleep duration was reliably associated with weight gain, adiposity, and obesity risk in both children and adults.4 Infants obtaining less than 12 hours of sleep/day, measured by maternal report, were more likely to be overweight at age 3 and have higher levels of adiposity.21 In a longitudinal study of children age 1 to age 7, sleep duration was associated with greater BMI increases, fat mass, and waist-to-hip ratio.22 In a controlled, laboratory-based experimental study, 3-year old children exposed to acute sleep restriction (skipping a nap and bedtime delayed ~2.3 hours) consumed greater amounts of carbohydrate and fat and more total calories23, which may explain the elevated risk of obesity caused by insufficient sleep. A recent review identified sleep as among the socioeconomic, family, environmental, and behavioral factors contributing to childhood obesity.24\n\nIn a longitudinal study of children in 3rd grade, bedtimes after 8pm were associated with greater odds of increased adiposity measured at 6th grade. As with children, insufficient sleep in adolescence has been shown to promote dietary behaviors that lead to obesity25, with additional effects mediated via decreased physical activity and neuroendocrine changes that bolster fat storage. More evidence is needed, particularly in interventions that counteract the effects of screen-media consumption leading to insufficient quantity or inadequate quality sleep, that in turn influence weight gain in childhood. However, the “weight” of available evidence suggests that obesity may be a sleep loss-related outcome of excessive screen-media consumption.\n\nWhat are the bedtime screen habits of infants, children, and adolescents?\n\nAlthough the scientific and clinical communities continue to express concern regarding the negative impacts of screen media on sleep, electronics in the bedroom and screen time use around bedtime remain common among youth.26–28 A large-scale, nationally representative sample of American parents in 201326 revealed that about one third (36%) of young children had TVs in their bedrooms, including 16% of children under 2 years of age, 37% of 2- to 4-year-olds, and 45% of 5- to 8-year-olds. Additionally, among parents of infants and young children who allowed a bedroom TV, 22% did so to help their child fall asleep, 14% did so to get their child to fall asleep in his/her own room, and 4% did so because their child slept in a family room containing a TV.26 The presence of a TV in the bedroom varies by cultural, socioeconomic and structural factors. Data from a 2016 nationally representative study of over 2,600 US youth indicated that 47% of tweens and 57% of teens have TVs in their bedrooms.27 Media devices in the bedroom were more common in lower-income youth (68% versus 37%). The authors speculated that the higher rate of media in the bedrooms of lower-income tweens and teens may be the result of more frequent room sharing, sleeping in a multi-purposed room, or differing family preferences. Parent-report data from the 2014 Sleep in America poll by the NSF revealed that 75% of youth keep at least one type of electronic device in their bedroom. The poll also found that the 28% of school-aged children and 57% of teenagers who leave an electronic device on in their bedroom after bedtime obtained less total sleep and had lower sleep quality.7\n\nAbout 50% of parents endorse the belief that watching TV helps their infant, toddler, or preschooler ‘wind down’ in the evening.28 Likewise, multiple studies documented that adolescents report using media at bedtime to “help” them fall asleep.29 There is a current programming trend toward developing calming shows and apps aimed at helping children relax before bedtime and transition to sleep. To our knowledge, no published research exists on the effectiveness of such content. Such evidence should be a minimum requirement for these approaches to be recommended.\n\nImportantly, over the past decade, the landscape of screen media devices has changed markedly, dramatically altering children and adolescents engage with their environment. Data from large national US samples in 2011 and 2013 show an increase in ownership of tablet devices in young children (age 0–8) from 8% to 40% and an increase in access to mobile “smart” devices at home from 52% to 75%.26 Another report indicated that, from 2011 to 2013, the percentage of children under 2 years of age who had used a mobile device rose from 10% to 38%.26\n\nScreen media, especially near bedtime, is adversely associated with sleep time and quantity\n\nIn relation to a growing interest in the association between screen time and sleep patterns, data from over 60 associated studies have been examined in two systematic literature reviews3,30 and two related meta-analyses31,32. In the time since those articles were published, at least a dozen more studies have surfaced (e.g., see6,8,33–42), from a wide-range of cultural contexts including Thailand,37 Saudi Arabia,40 and Norway.8\n\nThe vast majority of these studies indicate that the extent of screen time among children and adolescents is associated with delayed bedtime and shorter total sleep time 43–45. Several studies also found associations between screen time and reduced sleep quality,46,47 longer sleep onset latency,48 and increased daytime tiredness.49,50 One recent study found that electronic media use accounted for 30% of all variance in adolescent sleep efficiency, as measured by actigraphy.34 Most studies examined total daily screen time as a predictor, but even greater effects on sleep have been documented in evening media use in the bedroom (i.e., in the 1–2 hours before bedtime51,52) and in use of violent media at any time.53,54\n\nOne meta-analysis investigated the association between portable screen-based media devices and sleep outcomes.32 Merging results from 20 studies and over 125,000 youth, the authors consistently found that bedtime media usage is associated with insufficient sleep duration (OR=2.17, p<.001), poor sleep quality (OR=1.46, p<.01) and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR=2.72, p<0.01). This meta-analysis found that the mere presence of a portable screen-based media device in the bedroom has adverse associations with sleep outcomes. In one study of 600 preschoolers, those with a TV in their bedroom watched twice as much evening TV (about 28 versus 13 minutes, respectively) and watched more shows with violent/scary or ‘mature’ content (29% versus 13%).53 Most related studies focused on typically-developing children, but results of studies on children with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorders show similar patterns. One such study found that exposure to violent programming within 30 minutes before bedtime was associated with longer sleep latency and shorter sleep duration.54\n\nNegative associations with sleep have been found with use of a range of screen media devices, including television, computers, video games, and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.29,51,52,55–65 However, there are mixed results regarding whether the type, size, or interactivity level of the screen affects sleep outcomes. In a study of 2,048 children in grades four and seven, having either a TV or small screen device near where they sleep – as well as more daily screen time– was associated with obtaining less sleep.6 The rise in interactive media options may increase the impact of media use on sleep, as some studies have found that interactive screen media use (e.g. video games and mobile devices) may have a greater impact on sleep than passive use, such as watching television.6,45,66–71 One recent meta-analysis found no association between television watching and sleep duration,31 but did find that computer use is associated with shorter total sleep duration. Another study shows that use of interactive screen-media increases the odds of nighttime awakenings and daytime tiredness,41 but other studies examining the effects of video game use on sleep have shown more modest effects.68,72 One study compared 1 hour of bedtime tablet use with three different lighting profiles and found minimal differences in the impact on sleep and next-day functioning.73 However, longer durations of bright screen use (between 1.5–5 hours) have shown to increase alertness before sleep.74–77\n\nMechanisms through which screens affect sleep\n\nSince many of the existing studies are observational and cross-sectional, causality is difficult to discern. Several potential mechanisms, along with supporting evidence, are briefly discussed below: time displacement, psychological stimulation from content, and the alerting and circadian effects of light.\n\nTime displacement of sleep\n\nScreen media use can lead to behavioral bedtime delay, as children or adolescents postpone bedtime to prolong screen entertainment.66,78,79 Using a screen-based device displaces time that would otherwise have been spent sleeping. This time-displacement mechanism is particularly powerful when screens are used at night, when sleep is most likely the activity being directly offset.\n\nPsychological stimulation from media content disrupting sleep\n\nResearch has found mixed results regarding the effect of screen media use on psychological, emotional, and/or physiological arousal, but this relationship likely mediates some effect of screen media use on sleep.80–83 Video games, particularly violent games, are often thrilling for enthusiasts, typically simulating life-or-death experiences requiring players’ full attention to succeed. Violent videogame play before bed increase arousal compared to nonviolent gameplay. However, arousal is a likely mediator of sleep problems even in non-violent media use.46 In another controlled experiment, playing an “exciting” video game was associated with increased heart rate, slightly delayed sleep-onset, and decreased REM sleep, further suggesting that the effect of screen use on sleep is mediated via arousal.61\n\nEffects of light-emitting screens on child and adolescent sleep\n\nExposure to the light emitted by screens in the evening hours before and/or during bedtime is another likely mechanism by which use of screen media negatively impacts sleep. Screen-based light may affect sleep via several pathways:\n\nincreasing arousal and reducing sleepiness at bedtime,\n\ndisrupting sleep architecture as assessed by polysomnographic (PSG) recording, and\n\ndelaying the circadian rhythm and subsequently postponing sleep-onset, which results in shortened sleep duration unless wake-time is also delayed.\n\nStudies of young adults demonstrated that evening use of light-emitting devices increases alertness and decreases sleepiness before bedtime, as determined by cognitive performance, self-reported scales and waking EEG measures.74,76,84 These studies also showed that this light suppresses blood levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which normally increases in the hours before bedtime.74,76,77,84 Similar results were found in an experimental study of adolescents, in which exposure to LED screens before bedtime decreased self-reported sleepiness and melatonin levels.75 Exposure to non-screen artificial light in the evening also increases alertness (quelling underlying sleep drive) and suppresses melatonin levels, delaying sleep onset. The light emitted from screen media devices includes greater short-wavelength light in the blue light range, which has been shown to induce stronger melatonin-suppressing responses 85. In fact, in the aforementioned study of adolescents75, both subjective alertness and melatonin suppression were significantly attenuated when study participants wore glasses that filtered out short-wavelength light.\n\nFew studies have directly measured the effects of light from screens on polysomnographic (PSG) measures of sleep.73,75,76 One such study in young adults found that exposure to light-emitting devices before bedtime caused a phase delay of melatonin release and modestly increased the time to fall asleep and reduced the duration of REM sleep76. It is impossible to determine whether longer sleep latency or reduced REM sleep duration was due to decreased sleepiness before bedtime, suppression of melatonin, a phase delay of the circadian clock, or a combination of these factors. Other published reports, including a study of adolescents,73 found no significant changes on subsequent PSG with evening exposure to light-emitting devices.73,75\n\nAlthough limited research documents the effects of light from digital media on sleep, the results are particularly applicable to youth, who may be more sensitive to light than adults.86 One study 87 found that the magnitude of melatonin suppression induced by moderately bright indoor light levels in the evening was twice as much in primary school children as in adults. This difference could be related to pupil diameter, which is significantly larger in children than adults. Another study88 found that children showed significantly greater melatonin suppression compared to adolescents in response to varying degrees of evening light exposure. Taken together, these results suggest that the light from screen media use around bedtime adversely affects sleep, particularly in younger children. Furthermore, these findings indicate the need for further research on the effect of screen media devices on sleep, especially in youth.\n\nInternet and video game addiction and sleep\n\nThere is growing concern that technology habits can become uncontrollable and excessive to the point of interference with normal daily functioning. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V (DSM-V) recognizes one type of technology addiction, internet gaming disorder, as a “condition for further study”.89 More broadly, the concept of internet and video game addiction (IVGA), has gained traction in the psychological and psychiatric communities, due in part to the disorder’s deleterious effects on sleep. IVGA is classified as an inability of internet users to limit excessive internet use, with ensuing psychosocial dysfunction.90 A recent systematic literature review and other studies show a particularly strong association between use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and poor sleep quality.91–93 IVGA has been associated with subjective insomnia and insufficient sleep among afflicted adolescents.91 Existing literature on this association remains limited and causality is unproven, but there appears to be a strong association between IVGA and sleep problems.\n\nModerating factors\n\nNew evidence suggests some young people are particularly susceptible to the ill effects of screen media on sleep quality. As early as 2009, researchers documented individual differences in teenagers’ heart rate variability (HRV) when playing violent video games.83 A subsequent study46 demonstrated that adolescents’ level of gaming experience moderated the effect between their videogame use, HRV, and sleep. Inexperienced gamers reported poorer sleep after playing a violent video game, in contrast to experienced gamers who reported poorer sleep after a nonviolent videogame. Physiological trait differences can also amplify technology exposure effects by directly delaying bedtimes.52 An experimental laboratory study by Reynolds and colleagues79 revealed that adolescents who perceived fewer consequences from risk-taking were more likely to end daily video gaming sessions at a later time, thus delaying sleep onset, compared with their peers. Smith et al.94 found that adolescents who self-reported higher trait flow (the ability to easily immerse oneself into an activity) were also more likely to delay bedtime via extended periods of evening gaming. Their follow-up laboratory study replicated this effect, but only for videogames that were both challenging and enjoyable (i.e. when game difficulty was set to “hard” instead of “easy”). Similarly, poor self-control in combination with unstructured television viewing has been associated with delayed bedtimes in adults, a finding supported in a follow-up study.95 This emerging research suggests that identifying predisposing individual traits and characteristics of the technology use helps discern youth whose technology habits are most likely to delay sleep onset.\n\nInterventions, policies and strategies designed to improve child and adolescent sleep\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a Statement of Endorsement in support of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines, which recommends that screen-based devices not be allowed in children’s bedrooms and be turned off 30 minutes before bedtime.96 These are commonly suggested approaches, but modifying media content may be another effective means of protecting sleep. A randomized trial found that a harm-reduction intervention, which attempted to change the media exposure of preschool children away from violent and towards educational and prosocial content, significantly decreased odds of sleep problems across follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 months, compared with controls.97\n\nExperimental studies seeking to evaluate interventions to improve sleep outcomes in children and adolescents are sparse, and have typically incorporated multifaceted sleep hygiene programs that address multiple elements in addition to screen media before bed. Nevertheless, existing literature suggests that limiting screen time during the 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime may yield modest benefits in terms of “lights out time” as well as sleep quality and duration. A one-week program, consisting of classes teaching sleep physiology, biological significance, and consequences of sleep deprivation, resulted in more regular bedtimes and shorter sleep-onset latency among 58 adolescents (mean 16 years old), but no benefit on sleep quality or daytime sleepiness.98 Another investigation assessed the utility the FERRET (Food, Emotions, Routine, Restrict, Environment and Timing) sleep hygiene program among 22 adolescents (mean 13 years old). FERRET instructed adolescents to comply with three rules for each of the domains of the acronym (e.g. Restrict: No electronic media at least 30 minutes before bed, no exercise 3 hours before bed, no other activities in bed except for sleep).99 This program significantly improved scores on the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), although objective sleep duration did not change significantly. A targeted intervention of mobile phone restriction in the hour before bed among 63 adolescents (mean 16 years old) resulted in “lights out” 17 minutes earlier and a total sleep time increase of 19 minutes per night.100 However, the authors reported a low 26% recruitment rate, highlighting the difficulty of implementing such a regimented screen-limiting schedule in teens. In another study, limiting screen media around bedtime for healthy adolescents with good sleep did not significantly impact sleep outcomes. In a study of high school athletes (mean 17 years) whose baseline consisted of sufficient sleep (e.g. total sleep time, 7:49 weekdays, 9:11 weekends), a strict “no electronic media” rule after 10:00 pm resulted in no benefit in terms of total sleep time, sleep quality, or daytime functioning.101 In sum, limited existing research suggests that sleep hygiene interventions may be practically challenging to achieve but yield benefits to those children and adolescents with insufficent sleep. Larger, multi-site studies are urgently needed given the increasing intrusion of evening screen media use in of the lives of modern youth, including gaming, social media, and homework.\n\nClinician’s perspective\n\nClinicians can help families improve their sleep health and screen media habits by encouraging parenting marked by high levels of warmth and support, as well as limits that are clearly communicated, consistently applied appropriate to the child’s behavior and context, and allow for developmentally appropriate autonomy(i.e. an authoritative parenting style). 102,103 (See Box 1) All parents should begin instilling family bedtime routines and healthy sleep habits early in life, and adjust these routines as youth mature (See Box 2). If the youth health behaviors and habits become part of the child’s own daily routine, she will be better able to take charge of her own sleep health behaviors when this becomes appropriate in later years. For younger children, these routines mean establishing household rules related to screens and sleep early on. For older children and adolescents, they involve open conversation about the core reasons for behaviors. This proactive and engaged parenting style promotes cooperation and parent-child shared goals for children’s health and well-being, and aims to help children develop self-regulation skills, and eventually increasing autonomy to govern their own behavior.\n\nBox 1. Sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for clinicians and educators.\n\nTalk with families about the importance of adequate sleep.\n\nRecommend building healthy sleep habits starting as young as possible.\n\nTeach families about the negative effects of evening use of light-emitting screens on sleep.\n\nEncourage regular bedtimes that allow adequate time for sleep, and regular bedtime routines in the hour before bed, consisting of calming activities and avoidance of screen media.\n\nAdvise families to restrict all screen devices from bedrooms, including TVs, video games, computers, tablets, and cell phones.

Sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for parents.\n\nEstablish screen media habits for your children which enable healthy sleep.3,7,113\n\nPlan a bedtime that allows for adequate sleep.\n\nAvoid screen media in the hour before bedtime and at nighttime.\n\nReplace evening screen time with calm activities for your children (reading, coloring, conversation, etc.).\n\nKeep all screen devices (TVs, video games, computers, tablets, and smartphones) out of bedrooms.\n\nAvoid passive background media: Children may be affected by screen media even when they are not actively engaged.\n\nContent matters: Avoid violent and/or scary media, which can negatively affect your children’s sleep.\n\nFamily rules/routines are most effective when applied to all children in the household.\n\nEstablish other healthy sleep practices for your child and yourself.112,114,115\n\nSet and abide by regular bedtimes every day, including weekends, allowing the child sufficient sleep duration for his/her age.10\n\nBedtime should follow a predictable routine (e.g.: brush teeth, read a story, lights out).\n\nBedrooms should be cool (65–70 degrees), comfortable, dark, and quiet.\n\nAvoid evening intake of chocolate or beverages that interfere with sleep (soda, tea, coffee, energy drinks).\n\nInclude physical exercise into the daily routine, and spend time outdoors during sunlight hours when possible.\n\nBe a healthy sleep role model by prioritizing your own sleep.\n\nImprove your own sleep-related behaviors (e.g., reduce screen time before bedtime, establish a regular bedtime, etc.)114 to improve your health and well-being116\n\nTurn off electronic media devices in the evening throughout the household and charge all mobile devices in a central location outside bedrooms.\n\nParents who are overtired are less well able to parent effectively, including being proactive in orchestrating child routines and dealing effectively and calmly with daily hassles that are part of everyday life.\n\nParent your child with clear communication, awareness, and fair, consistent, developmentally appropriate rules.117\n\nTalk with your child or teen early and often about the importance of adequate sleep for optimal health.\n\nBe aware of how much time your child or teen spends engaging in screen media, including before and after bedtime.76\n\nPay attention to your child or teen’s mood and behavior at home, and discuss concerns you may have. Mood impairment is often caused by inadequate sleep.\n\nEstablish and enforce appropriate media and sleep rules for your children as early in their lives as possible; consistently point out after-effects of failing to follow those rules (e.g., being tired and cranky the next day after playing games too late) to develop your child’s understanding of the effects of inadequate sleep.\n\nWork with teens to jointly develop healthy sleep routines that also allow them to meet obligations (e.g., homework or sports) and are consistent with the guidelines above. Developing autonomy and ability to self-regulate is important for teens, as is consistency.\n\nExamples from health psychology provide accessible guidance. A teen with a healthy diet does not typically result from the rigid imposition of a such a diet after a lifetime of unhealthy foods, but with a healthy and balanced eating habits instilled from a young age. A healthy “screen media diet” may be a resonant and useful concept for many children, parents, educators, and clinicians. It is difficult for parents who smoke to mandate a no-smoking policy. Role modeling and a health-risk prevention approach is far more likely to be effective than a secondary prevention approach (e.g smoking cessation). Successful parenting ideally starts early and sets appropriate norms and boundaries while maintaining parental warmth, rather than holding off on setting boundaries until a problem develops requiring discipline. Encouraging the development of age-appropriate autonomy will help teenagers to develop a sense of responsibility for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nFor teenagers presenting with excessive screen time, a few clinical pearls may help families to follow the recommendations laid out in Box 1 and 2, below. First, one must always focus on the chief complaint, what brought the patient to seek help in the first place. In cases of excessive nighttime screen media use, children and adolescents are often seen in the clinician’s office for poor academic performance or lack of concentration in school. Upon taking a careful history, the clinician often discovers a significant lack of sleep, often attributable to patients staying up late while using mobile devices, computers, or videogames. Clinicians must discover the underlying factors (e.g., social or family stress) which drive the patient to use the screens in the late hours. Addressing such factors directly may be essential to motivating families to achieve healthier screen habits.\n\nThe clinicians should then work with families to reduce evening and nighttime screen media use via structural and behavioral modifications in order to improve sleep health (See Box 2). Many adolescents are reluctant to change their health behaviors,104 yet providing them with education about the positive benefits of sufficient sleep as well as the negative consequences of poor sleep can help motivate such change.105–109 For example, pointing out that a change in sleep habits may improve concentration, daytime alertness, and academic performance may motivate youth to modify nighttime habits. Discussing the negative repercussions of inadequate sleep on qualities that are important to the patient, such as body weight or athletic performance, may likewise motivate the patient to reduce nighttime screen media use and establish other healthy bedtime habits. Perhaps most importantly, parents and children should remove screen-based devices from the bedroom to ensure that they are not used at night.\n\nChanging bedtime screen media use habits in our young patients is challenging. However, several tools and strategies increase our chances of success, with the goal of promoting healthy sleep habits that children and adolescents will continue to follow throughout their lives.\n\nRecommendations for clinicians, educators, and parents\n\nBased on our current understanding of clinical practice and sleep health research, we have developed sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for clinicians and educators (see Box 1) and for parents (see Box 2) to help minimize the adverse effects of screen-based media on the sleep of children and adolescents.\n\nFuture directions\n\nResearch indicates that screen-based media represents a threat to the sleep quality of youth, many of whom already have insufficient sleep. However, very few studies demonstrate easy-to-implement and effective interventions. Future research should develop, implement, and evaluate sustainable interventions that minimize the adverse effects of evening screen use on sleep. For example, a means of reducing fear of missing out from social media and other screen-based activities may significantly improve the sleep of adolescents.110,111 There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research into the effects of screen-based media on sleep and related health consequences among children and adolescents, in order to educate and motivate parents, clinicians, teachers, and youth to foster healthy sleep habits.\n\nKey points.\n\nUse of screen media by youth, throughout the day and in the period before bedtime, is associated with shorter total sleep time and delayed sleep onset in over five dozen studies from around the world. Access to a screen-media device in the bedroom at night is associated with shorter sleep duration, later bedtime, and poorer sleep quality.\n\nThe currently-supported mechanisms underlying the relationship between screen media habits and sleep outcomes include (1) displacement of time spent sleeping by time spent using screens, (2) psychological stimulation from screen-media content, and (3) alerting and circadian effects of exposure to light from screens.\n\nClinicians, educators, and parents should prioritize the need of youth to get sufficient sleep through maintaining regular and consistent bedtime routines. In addition, youth and parents should practice sleep-friendly screen behaviors: restricting exposure to digital media in the hour before bedtime, turning devices off during the night, and keeping devices out of bedrooms. Modifying media content to reduce psychological stimulation (e.g., limiting violent or scary media) may also reduce adverse impact on sleep.\n\nThere is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep and related health and health behavior consequences among children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth to maintain healthy sleep habits.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to Guest Editor, Paul Weigle, MD for his careful review and constructive feedback on this manuscript.\n\nFootnotes\n\nDisclosures: Authors on this paper were in part supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R01HD073352 (supporting Dr. Hale, Dr. Chang, G.

Abstract

(1) Background: Sleep is considered to be a complex condition for human beings, with the aim of ensuring physical and psychological recovery. Technology, including the cell phone, is a tool for teenagers that ensures they are always available to interact, even at night. This study aims to understand the influence of the use of smartphones on adolescent sleep quality. (2) Methods: The guidelines proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed. The search was conducted in October 2022 through the EBSCOhost platform, with access to the CINAHL Complete and Medline databases and through the b-On database. (3) Results: The use of electronic equipment plays an important role in adolescents’ lives. There is a negative relationship between the use of electronic equipment, such as smartphones, and sleep, for reducing both the quality and quantity of sleep. There is also a relationship between nighttime smartphone use, insufficient sleep, and mental health problems. (4) Conclusions: The use of new technologies at night causes a change in the behavior of adolescents with repercussions in terms of the quality of sleep and sleep duration and consequent well-being and performance during the day.

Keywords: smartphone, children, well-being, sleep, teenagers, media

1. Introduction

Sleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].

In a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).

The circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].

As it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.

The World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.

For good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.

Nowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].

This permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).

The Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.

Considering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.

2. Materials and Methods

A Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).

Using the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”

The search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.

The articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.

Among the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.

All articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.

Regarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.

All studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.

The analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].

Johansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.

In fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

4. Discussion

Adolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].

Technological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].

Schweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

The constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.

If, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.

The high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.

In fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.

The studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.

Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.

According to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].

Many authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.

In Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).

Meeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).

This study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.

Therefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.

Nursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).

Johansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].

In this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].

It is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.

5. Conclusions

It was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.

The influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.

It becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.

Based on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.

6. Limitations/Future Prospects

Limitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.

Introduction\n\nSleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].\n\nIn a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).\n\nThe circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].\n\nAs it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.\n\nThe World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.\n\nFor good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.\n\nNowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].\n\nThis permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).\n\nThe Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.\n\nConsidering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nA Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).\n\nUsing the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”\n\nThe search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.\n\nThe articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.\n\nAmong the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nPRISMA of study selection and inclusion process [10].\n\nAfter the selection of studies, they were evaluated critically by applying assessment grids of the level of evidence, reliability, and relevance, which allowed us to classify the studies found (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.\n\nCritical evaluation of the results of the included studies according to the critical evaluation verification list by Joanna Briggs Institute [11].\n\nArticles\tQ1\tQ2\tQ3\tQ4\tQ5\tQ6\tQ7\tQ8\tQ9\tQ10\tResult\nTavernier et al.

One month after, the students were visited a second time and completed the same questionnaire.\nOpen in a new tab\n\nAll articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.\n\nRegarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.\n\nAll studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.\n\nThe analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].\n\nJohansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.\n\nIn fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nLikewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAdolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].\n\nTechnological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].\n\nSchweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nThe constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.\n\nIf, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.\n\nThe high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.\n\nIn fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.\n\nThe studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.\n\nLike these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.\n\nAccording to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].\n\nMany authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.\n\nIn Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).\n\nMeeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).\n\nThis study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.\n\nTherefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.\n\nNursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).\n\nJohansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].\n\nIn this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].\n\nIt is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIt was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.\n\nThe influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.\n\nIt becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.\n\nBased on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.\n\n6. Limitations/Future Prospects\n\nLimitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.d.C.M. and M.C.; methodology, S.d.S., A.B. and M.C.; software, M.J.R. and H.M.; validation, H.M., S.D. and M.J.R.; formal analysis, S.d.S.; investigation, M.J.R. and S.D.; resources, S.d.S. and A.B.; data curation, M.d.C.M.; writing—original draft preparation, S.d.S. and A.B.; writing—review and editing, M.J.R.; visualization, S.D.; supervision, M.C.; project administration, S.d.S. and M.d.C.M.

This report aims to explore the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among boarding school students. It further seeks to compare these effects with students who have restricted phone access after bedtime. The insights are drawn from studies conducted on similar populations, such as university students, to extrapolate findings relevant to boarding school environments.\n\n## Literature Review\n\n### Smartphone Usage and Sleep Quality\n\nSmartphone usage, particularly at bedtime, has been extensively studied for its impact on sleep quality. The light emitted from smartphone screens can suppress melatonin production, a hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles, thereby disrupting the circadian rhythm (Chang et al., 2015). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a commonly used tool to assess sleep quality, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality (Buysse et al., 1989).\n\n#### Key Findings from Related Studies\n\n1. **Prevalence of Smartphone Use**: A study conducted at Al-Azhar University found that 96.5% of students used smartphones at bedtime, with social media being the most common activity (Al-Mutawa et al., 2022).\n2. **Impact on Sleep Quality**: The same study reported that 64.2% of bedtime smartphone users were classified as poor sleepers, exhibiting increased sleep latency and shorter sleep duration (Al-Mutawa et al., 2022).\n\n### Smartphone Usage and Academic Performance\n\nThe relationship between smartphone usage and academic performance is complex. While smartphones can be used for educational purposes, excessive use, especially at bedtime, has been linked to decreased academic performance due to its impact on sleep quality and cognitive functioning (Lepp et al., 2015).\n\n#### Key Findings from Related Studies\n\n1. **Academic Performance**: A study at Universiti Putra Malaysia found a significant negative correlation between bedtime mobile phone use and academic performance, suggesting that students who frequently use their phones at bedtime tend to have lower academic achievements (Samaha & Hawi, 2016).\n2. **Cognitive Functioning**: The same study did not find a significant relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and cognitive functioning, indicating that the impact on academic performance may be more directly related to sleep quality (Samaha & Hawi, 2016).\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis report synthesizes findings from existing studies to draw conclusions relevant to boarding school students. The primary studies referenced include cross-sectional analyses conducted at Al-Azhar University and Universiti Putra Malaysia. These studies utilized self-administered questionnaires, the PSQI, and cognitive tests to gather data on smartphone usage, sleep quality, and academic performance.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n### Effects on Sleep Quality\n\n| **Factor**                  | **Boarding School Students (Hypothetical)** | **University Students (Al-Azhar Study)** |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Prevalence of Smartphone Use| High                                        | 96.5%                                    |\n| Poor Sleep Quality          | Likely High                                 | 64.2%                                    |\n| Sleep Latency               | Increased                                   | Increased                                |\n| Sleep Duration              | Shortened                                   | Shortened                                |\n\n### Effects on Academic Performance\n\n| **Factor**                  | **Boarding School Students (Hypothetical)** | **University Students (UPM Study)**      |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Academic Performance        | Decreased                                   | Decreased                                |\n| Cognitive Functioning       | Potentially Affected                        | Not Significantly Affected               |\n\n### Restricted vs. Unrestricted Access\n\n| **Access Type**             | **Sleep Quality**                           | **Academic Performance**                 |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Restricted Access           | Improved                                    | Potentially Improved                     |\n| Unrestricted Access         | Poorer                                      | Decreased                                |\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe findings from the studies on university students provide a basis for understanding the potential effects of smartphone usage on boarding school students. The high prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime is likely to be similar among boarding school students, given the ubiquitous nature of smartphones. The negative impact on sleep quality, as evidenced by increased sleep latency and shorter sleep duration, can lead to decreased academic performance due to fatigue and reduced concentration.\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime could mitigate these negative effects. Boarding schools that implement policies to limit smartphone use during late hours may see improvements in students' sleep quality and academic outcomes. Encouraging physical activity and educating students about the adverse effects of nighttime smartphone use are additional strategies that could be employed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among university students provide valuable insights that can be extrapolated to boarding school students. The negative impact of bedtime smartphone use on sleep quality is well-established, and its subsequent effect on academic performance is a significant concern. Restricting smartphone access after bedtime appears to be a viable strategy to improve sleep hygiene and academic outcomes among boarding school students.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Education**: Implement educational programs to raise awareness about the impact of smartphone use on sleep and academic performance.\n2. **Policy Implementation**: Boarding schools should consider policies that restrict smartphone use during late hours to promote better sleep hygiene.\n3. **Encouragement of Physical Activity**: Promote regular physical activity as a means to improve sleep quality and overall well-being.\n\n## References\n\n- Al-Mutawa, N., Al-Mutairi, A., & Al-Mutairi, M.

This report synthesizes findings from a comprehensive review of literature on the subject, focusing on the documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers' sleep and academic outcomes. Additionally, it explores how restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools might improve these outcomes. The report aims to provide a structured analysis, supported by empirical evidence, to inform policy and practice in educational settings.\n\n## Effects of Smartphone Usage on Teenagers' Sleep Quality\n\n### Disruption of Circadian Rhythms\n\nSmartphone usage, particularly exposure to blue light emitted by screens, disrupts circadian rhythms by suppressing melatonin secretion. Melatonin is a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles. The suppression of melatonin due to blue light exposure, especially at night, can delay sleep onset and reduce sleep efficiency (Cajochen et al., 2011).\n\n### Sleep Displacement\n\nSmartphones are often used for unstructured leisure activities, leading to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use can extend into late hours, reducing total sleep time. This displacement is a significant factor contributing to insufficient sleep among adolescents (Cain & Gradisar, 2010).\n\n### Content-Induced Arousal\n\nThe type of content consumed on smartphones, such as activating music or stimulating games, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset, further affecting sleep quality. This content-induced arousal is particularly problematic when smartphones are used before bedtime (Hale & Guan, 2015).\n\n### Sleep Duration and Quality\n\nStudies indicate that smartphone use is associated with shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness. These effects are particularly pronounced when smartphones are used before bedtime. A meta-analysis by Carter et al. (2016) found that screen time is negatively associated with sleep outcomes in children and adolescents.\n\n### Bidirectional Relationship\n\nThere is evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship where poor sleep quality may lead to increased smartphone use, creating a cycle of sleep disruption. This cyclical pattern exacerbates the negative impact on sleep and overall well-being (Wolniczak et al., 2013).\n\n## Impact on Academic Performance\n\n### Cognitive Impairment\n\nSleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and learning. Sleep deprivation due to smartphone use can impair cognitive functions, affecting memory, attention, and the ability to learn new information. This impairment is detrimental to academic performance (Curcio et al., 2006).\n\n### Academic Outcomes\n\nEpidemiological studies consistently demonstrate a relationship between sleep quality and academic performance. Poor sleep due to excessive smartphone use can lead to subpar academic outcomes, increased stress, and poor mental health. A study by Dewald et al. (2010) found a significant correlation between sleep duration and academic performance in adolescents.\n\n### Psychiatric Implications\n\nSleep deprivation is linked to the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation issues and depression, which can further impact academic performance. Adolescents with poor sleep are more likely to experience mood disorders, which can hinder their academic success (Roberts et al., 2009).\n\n### Public Health Recommendations\n\nThe review suggests that restricting smartphone use before bedtime can improve sleep quality and, consequently, academic performance. Guidelines recommend limiting screen time to no more than two hours per day for adolescents (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016).\n\n## Potential Benefits of Restricting Smartphone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools\n\n### Improved Sleep Quality\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime can help students achieve better sleep hygiene, leading to improved sleep quality and duration. This can enhance physical and psychological recovery during sleep, promoting overall health and well-being (Gradisar et al., 2013).\n\n### Enhanced Academic Performance\n\nWith better sleep, students are likely to experience improved cognitive function, attention, and memory, which are critical for academic success. Reduced daytime sleepiness can lead to better focus and engagement in classroom activities (Wolfson & Carskadon, 2003).\n\n### Positive Mental Health Outcomes\n\nLimiting smartphone use at night can reduce the risk of mental health issues associated with poor sleep, such as depression and anxiety, thereby supporting overall well-being and academic resilience (Owens et al., 2014).\n\n### Promotion of Healthy Sleep Habits\n\nBoarding schools can play a pivotal role in instilling good sleep hygiene practices by educating students about the importance of sleep and the detrimental effects of nighttime technology use. This education can foster long-term healthy habits (Mindell et al., 2009).\n\n### Supportive Environment for Growth\n\nBy creating an environment that prioritizes sleep, boarding schools can support the holistic development of adolescents, fostering both academic and personal growth. This supportive environment can enhance students' overall quality of life (Carskadon, 2011).\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Establish Clear Policies\n\nSchools should develop and enforce policies that restrict smartphone use during the hour before bedtime. These policies should be communicated clearly to students, parents, and staff to ensure compliance and understanding (National Sleep Foundation, 2014).\n\n### Educate Students and Staff\n\nProvide education on the importance of sleep and the negative effects of screen time on sleep quality. This education should be integrated into the school curriculum and supported by workshops and seminars (Owens et al., 2014).\n\n### Create a Supportive Environment\n\nEncourage alternative pre-bedtime activities that promote relaxation, such as reading or meditation. Schools can provide resources and spaces for these activities to support students' transition to bedtime (Mindell et al., 2009).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe systematic literature review provides substantial evidence that smartphone usage negatively affects adolescents' sleep quality, which in turn impacts their academic performance and overall well-being. Restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools could significantly improve sleep hygiene, leading to enhanced academic outcomes and overall well-being for teenagers. Implementing such measures, alongside educational initiatives on sleep health, could be a strategic approach to addressing the challenges posed by nighttime smartphone use among adolescents. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term effects of smartphone use on adolescent health and academic outcomes.\n\n## References\n\n- American Academy of Pediatrics. (2016).

This report aims to explore the documented effects of smartphone usage on these two critical aspects of teenage life. Additionally, it examines the potential benefits of restricting phone access after bedtime, particularly in boarding school settings, to improve these outcomes. The analysis draws on existing studies, including those focused on adults and younger children, to extrapolate findings relevant to teenagers.\n\n## Smartphone Usage and Sleep Quality\n\n### Overview of Sleep Quality Concerns\n\nSleep quality is a crucial determinant of overall health and well-being, particularly during adolescence, a period marked by rapid physical and cognitive development. Poor sleep quality can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including impaired cognitive function, mood disturbances, and increased risk of chronic health conditions.\n\n### Documented Effects of Smartphone Usage on Sleep\n\n#### Findings from Adult Studies\n\nWhile the primary study referenced focuses on adults aged 20 to 60 years, its findings offer valuable insights into the broader implications of smartphone usage on sleep quality. Key results indicate that higher mobile phone usage is significantly associated with poorer sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Specifically, 22.61% of participants reported poor sleep quality, with a significant correlation between high phone usage and increased sleep latency and disrupted sleep stages.\n\n#### Extrapolation to Teenagers\n\nTeenagers, like adults, are susceptible to the negative effects of excessive smartphone use on sleep. The blue light emitted by screens can interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Additionally, the stimulating nature of social media and other smartphone activities can delay sleep onset and reduce overall sleep duration.\n\n### Potential Benefits of Restricting Phone Access After Bedtime\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools could mitigate these negative effects by:\n\n1. **Reducing Sleep Latency**: Limiting exposure to blue light and stimulating content before sleep can help teenagers fall asleep more quickly.\n2. **Improving Sleep Duration and Quality**: By minimizing disruptions, teenagers are more likely to achieve the recommended 8-10 hours of sleep per night.\n3. **Enhancing Daytime Functioning**: Improved sleep quality can lead to better cognitive performance, mood regulation, and overall health.\n\n## Smartphone Usage and Academic Performance\n\n### Overview of Academic Performance Concerns\n\nAcademic performance is a key indicator of future success and is influenced by a variety of factors, including cognitive abilities, motivation, and environmental conditions. The role of technology, particularly smartphones, in shaping academic outcomes is a topic of growing interest.\n\n### Documented Effects of Smartphone Usage on Academic Performance\n\n#### Findings from Studies on Younger Populations\n\nThe study on elementary school students in Taiwan provides insights into the relationship between smartphone use and academic performance. It found a positive correlation between smartphone use and academic outcomes, mediated by the nature of smartphone activities. Students who used smartphones for educational purposes tended to perform better academically.\n\n#### Extrapolation to Teenagers\n\nFor teenagers, the impact of smartphone use on academic performance is likely to be complex and multifaceted. While smartphones can serve as valuable educational tools, they also pose significant risks for distraction and time-wasting. The balance between these opposing effects is influenced by factors such as self-control, parental guidance, and the specific ways in which smartphones are used.\n\n### Potential Benefits of Restricting Phone Access After Bedtime\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools could enhance academic performance by:\n\n1. **Reducing Distractions**: Limiting access to non-educational content can help teenagers focus on their studies and reduce procrastination.\n2. **Promoting Better Sleep**: As previously discussed, improved sleep quality can enhance cognitive function and academic performance.\n3. **Encouraging Healthy Habits**: Establishing boundaries around smartphone use can foster self-discipline and time management skills.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nTo further elucidate the potential benefits of restricting smartphone access after bedtime, a comparative analysis of sleep quality and academic performance outcomes is presented in Table 1.\n\n| **Outcome**                  | **Unrestricted Access** | **Restricted Access** |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Sleep Latency                | Increased               | Decreased             |\n| Sleep Duration               | Reduced                 | Increased             |\n| Sleep Quality                | Poor                    | Improved              |\n| Academic Performance         | Variable                | Enhanced              |\n| Cognitive Function           | Impaired                | Improved              |\n| Daytime Alertness            | Reduced                 | Increased             |\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe findings from existing studies underscore the significant impact of smartphone usage on both sleep quality and academic performance among teenagers. While the direct evidence from teenage populations is limited, extrapolations from studies on adults and younger children suggest that excessive smartphone use, particularly before bedtime, can have detrimental effects.\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools presents a promising strategy to mitigate these negative outcomes. By fostering an environment conducive to healthy sleep patterns and focused academic engagement, such policies could enhance the overall well-being and success of teenagers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance highlight the need for targeted interventions to manage technology use among teenagers. Restricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools offers a practical approach to improving these outcomes, with potential benefits for both individual students and the broader educational community.

This report aims to explore the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among boarding school students. It further seeks to compare these effects with students who have restricted phone access after bedtime. The insights are drawn from studies conducted on similar populations, such as university students, to extrapolate findings relevant to boarding school environments.\n\n## Literature Review\n\n### Smartphone Usage and Sleep Quality\n\nSmartphone usage, particularly at bedtime, has been extensively studied for its impact on sleep quality. The light emitted from smartphone screens can suppress melatonin production, a hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles, thereby disrupting the circadian rhythm (Chang et al., 2015). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a commonly used tool to assess sleep quality, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality (Buysse et al., 1989).\n\n#### Key Findings from Related Studies\n\n1. **Prevalence of Smartphone Use**: A study conducted at Al-Azhar University found that 96.5% of students used smartphones at bedtime, with social media being the most common activity (Al-Mutawa et al., 2022).\n2. **Impact on Sleep Quality**: The same study reported that 64.2% of bedtime smartphone users were classified as poor sleepers, exhibiting increased sleep latency and shorter sleep duration (Al-Mutawa et al., 2022).\n\n### Smartphone Usage and Academic Performance\n\nThe relationship between smartphone usage and academic performance is complex. While smartphones can be used for educational purposes, excessive use, especially at bedtime, has been linked to decreased academic performance due to its impact on sleep quality and cognitive functioning (Lepp et al., 2015).\n\n#### Key Findings from Related Studies\n\n1. **Academic Performance**: A study at Universiti Putra Malaysia found a significant negative correlation between bedtime mobile phone use and academic performance, suggesting that students who frequently use their phones at bedtime tend to have lower academic achievements (Samaha & Hawi, 2016).\n2. **Cognitive Functioning**: The same study did not find a significant relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and cognitive functioning, indicating that the impact on academic performance may be more directly related to sleep quality (Samaha & Hawi, 2016).\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis report synthesizes findings from existing studies to draw conclusions relevant to boarding school students. The primary studies referenced include cross-sectional analyses conducted at Al-Azhar University and Universiti Putra Malaysia. These studies utilized self-administered questionnaires, the PSQI, and cognitive tests to gather data on smartphone usage, sleep quality, and academic performance.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n### Effects on Sleep Quality\n\n| **Factor**                  | **Boarding School Students (Hypothetical)** | **University Students (Al-Azhar Study)** |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Prevalence of Smartphone Use| High                                        | 96.5%                                    |\n| Poor Sleep Quality          | Likely High                                 | 64.2%                                    |\n| Sleep Latency               | Increased                                   | Increased                                |\n| Sleep Duration              | Shortened                                   | Shortened                                |\n\n### Effects on Academic Performance\n\n| **Factor**                  | **Boarding School Students (Hypothetical)** | **University Students (UPM Study)**      |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Academic Performance        | Decreased                                   | Decreased                                |\n| Cognitive Functioning       | Potentially Affected                        | Not Significantly Affected               |\n\n### Restricted vs. Unrestricted Access\n\n| **Access Type**             | **Sleep Quality**                           | **Academic Performance**                 |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Restricted Access           | Improved                                    | Potentially Improved                     |\n| Unrestricted Access         | Poorer                                      | Decreased                                |\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe findings from the studies on university students provide a basis for understanding the potential effects of smartphone usage on boarding school students. The high prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime is likely to be similar among boarding school students, given the ubiquitous nature of smartphones. The negative impact on sleep quality, as evidenced by increased sleep latency and shorter sleep duration, can lead to decreased academic performance due to fatigue and reduced concentration.\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime could mitigate these negative effects. Boarding schools that implement policies to limit smartphone use during late hours may see improvements in students' sleep quality and academic outcomes. Encouraging physical activity and educating students about the adverse effects of nighttime smartphone use are additional strategies that could be employed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among university students provide valuable insights that can be extrapolated to boarding school students. The negative impact of bedtime smartphone use on sleep quality is well-established, and its subsequent effect on academic performance is a significant concern. Restricting smartphone access after bedtime appears to be a viable strategy to improve sleep hygiene and academic outcomes among boarding school students.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Education**: Implement educational programs to raise awareness about the impact of smartphone use on sleep and academic performance.\n2. **Policy Implementation**: Boarding schools should consider policies that restrict smartphone use during late hours to promote better sleep hygiene.\n3. **Encouragement of Physical Activity**: Promote regular physical activity as a means to improve sleep quality and overall well-being.\n\n## References\n\n- Al-Mutawa, N., Al-Mutairi, A., & Al-Mutairi, M.

By allowing students some degree of autonomy over their smartphone usage, we can encourage them to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.\n\nMoreover, while restricting smartphone access might improve sleep quality, it is essential to consider alternative strategies that empower students to adopt healthy sleep habits independently. Educational initiatives that inform students about the effects of screen time on sleep and provide them with tools to manage their technology use can be more effective in the long term [Source: Mindell et al., 2009].\n\nIn conclusion, while there is evidence supporting the restriction of smartphone access after bedtime to enhance sleep and academic performance, it is equally important to foster an environment that encourages personal responsibility and informed decision-making among students. By combining policy measures with educational efforts, we can support our children's development into well-rounded, responsible individuals.\nPrincipal: As Principal, my position on the issue of whether boarding schools should take phones after bedtime is firmly in favor of implementing such a policy. This stance is supported by a wealth of research indicating the detrimental effects of smartphone usage on both sleep quality and academic performance among students.\n\nFirstly, the impact of smartphone usage on sleep quality is well-documented. The light emitted from smartphone screens can suppress melatonin production, a hormone essential for regulating sleep-wake cycles, thereby disrupting students' circadian rhythms [Source: Chang et al., 2015]. This disruption is significant, as evidenced by a study where 64.2% of students using smartphones at bedtime were classified as poor sleepers, experiencing increased sleep latency and shorter sleep duration [Source: Al-Mutawa et al., 2022]. Poor sleep quality is directly linked to decreased academic performance due to fatigue and reduced concentration [Source: Samaha & Hawi, 2016].\n\nMoreover, the prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime is alarmingly high, with studies showing that 96.5% of students engage in this behavior, primarily for social media activities [Source: Al-Mutawa et al., 2022]. This widespread usage exacerbates the negative impact on sleep and academic outcomes.\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime has been shown to improve sleep quality and potentially enhance academic performance [Source: Comparative Analysis]. By implementing policies that limit smartphone use during late hours, boarding schools can foster an environment conducive to better sleep hygiene and academic success.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence strongly supports the restriction of smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools to mitigate the adverse effects on students' sleep and academic performance. This approach aligns with our responsibility to promote the well-being and educational achievement of our students.\n    ## RESEARCH INFORMATION\n    \n\nResearch Query: What are the documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers' sleep quality and academic performance, and how might restricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools improve these outcomes?\nResearch Result: # Research Report: The Effects of Smartphone Usage on Teenagers' Sleep Quality and Academic Performance, and the Potential Benefits of Restricting Phone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe pervasive use of smartphones among adolescents has raised significant concerns regarding its impact on sleep quality and academic performance. This report synthesizes findings from a comprehensive review of literature on the subject, focusing on the documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers' sleep and academic outcomes. Additionally, it explores how restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools might improve these outcomes. The report aims to provide a structured analysis, supported by empirical evidence, to inform policy and practice in educational settings.\n\n## Effects of Smartphone Usage on Teenagers' Sleep Quality\n\n### Disruption of Circadian Rhythms\n\nSmartphone usage, particularly exposure to blue light emitted by screens, disrupts circadian rhythms by suppressing melatonin secretion. Melatonin is a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles. The suppression of melatonin due to blue light exposure, especially at night, can delay sleep onset and reduce sleep efficiency (Cajochen et al., 2011).\n\n### Sleep Displacement\n\nSmartphones are often used for unstructured leisure activities, leading to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use can extend into late hours, reducing total sleep time. This displacement is a significant factor contributing to insufficient sleep among adolescents (Cain & Gradisar, 2010).\n\n### Content-Induced Arousal\n\nThe type of content consumed on smartphones, such as activating music or stimulating games, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset, further affecting sleep quality. This content-induced arousal is particularly problematic when smartphones are used before bedtime (Hale & Guan, 2015).\n\n### Sleep Duration and Quality\n\nStudies indicate that smartphone use is associated with shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness. These effects are particularly pronounced when smartphones are used before bedtime. A meta-analysis by Carter et al. (2016) found that screen time is negatively associated with sleep outcomes in children and adolescents.\n\n### Bidirectional Relationship\n\nThere is evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship where poor sleep quality may lead to increased smartphone use, creating a cycle of sleep disruption. This cyclical pattern exacerbates the negative impact on sleep and overall well-being (Wolniczak et al., 2013).\n\n## Impact on Academic Performance\n\n### Cognitive Impairment\n\nSleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and learning. Sleep deprivation due to smartphone use can impair cognitive functions, affecting memory, attention, and the ability to learn new information. This impairment is detrimental to academic performance (Curcio et al., 2006).\n\n### Academic Outcomes\n\nEpidemiological studies consistently demonstrate a relationship between sleep quality and academic performance. Poor sleep due to excessive smartphone use can lead to subpar academic outcomes, increased stress, and poor mental health. A study by Dewald et al. (2010) found a significant correlation between sleep duration and academic performance in adolescents.\n\n### Psychiatric Implications\n\nSleep deprivation is linked to the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation issues and depression, which can further impact academic performance. Adolescents with poor sleep are more likely to experience mood disorders, which can hinder their academic success (Roberts et al., 2009).\n\n### Public Health Recommendations\n\nThe review suggests that restricting smartphone use before bedtime can improve sleep quality and, consequently, academic performance. Guidelines recommend limiting screen time to no more than two hours per day for adolescents (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016).\n\n## Potential Benefits of Restricting Smartphone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools\n\n### Improved Sleep Quality\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime can help students achieve better sleep hygiene, leading to improved sleep quality and duration. This can enhance physical and psychological recovery during sleep, promoting overall health and well-being (Gradisar et al., 2013).\n\n### Enhanced Academic Performance\n\nWith better sleep, students are likely to experience improved cognitive function, attention, and memory, which are critical for academic success. Reduced daytime sleepiness can lead to better focus and engagement in classroom activities (Wolfson & Carskadon, 2003).\n\n### Positive Mental Health Outcomes\n\nLimiting smartphone use at night can reduce the risk of mental health issues associated with poor sleep, such as depression and anxiety, thereby supporting overall well-being and academic resilience (Owens et al., 2014).\n\n### Promotion of Healthy Sleep Habits\n\nBoarding schools can play a pivotal role in instilling good sleep hygiene practices by educating students about the importance of sleep and the detrimental effects of nighttime technology use. This education can foster long-term healthy habits (Mindell et al., 2009).\n\n### Supportive Environment for Growth\n\nBy creating an environment that prioritizes sleep, boarding schools can support the holistic development of adolescents, fostering both academic and personal growth. This supportive environment can enhance students' overall quality of life (Carskadon, 2011).\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Establish Clear Policies\n\nSchools should develop and enforce policies that restrict smartphone use during the hour before bedtime. These policies should be communicated clearly to students, parents, and staff to ensure compliance and understanding (National Sleep Foundation, 2014).\n\n### Educate Students and Staff\n\nProvide education on the importance of sleep and the negative effects of screen time on sleep quality. This education should be integrated into the school curriculum and supported by workshops and seminars (Owens et al., 2014).\n\n### Create a Supportive Environment\n\nEncourage alternative pre-bedtime activities that promote relaxation, such as reading or meditation. Schools can provide resources and spaces for these activities to support students' transition to bedtime (Mindell et al., 2009).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe systematic literature review provides substantial evidence that smartphone usage negatively affects adolescents' sleep quality, which in turn impacts their academic performance and overall well-being. Restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools could significantly improve sleep hygiene, leading to enhanced academic outcomes and overall well-being for teenagers. Implementing such measures, alongside educational initiatives on sleep health, could be a strategic approach to addressing the challenges posed by nighttime smartphone use among adolescents. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term effects of smartphone use on adolescent health and academic outcomes.\n\n## References\n\n- American Academy of Pediatrics. (2016).

By combining policy measures with educational efforts, we can support our children's development into well-rounded, responsible individuals.\n\nJohn: As a student, my perspective on the issue of restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools is primarily focused on the potential benefits for sleep quality and academic performance, which are crucial for our overall well-being and success.\n\nFirstly, the research clearly indicates that smartphone usage at bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep quality. The blue light emitted by screens interferes with melatonin production, delaying sleep onset and reducing sleep efficiency [Source: Cajochen et al., 2011]. This disruption can lead to shorter sleep duration and increased daytime sleepiness, which negatively impacts cognitive functions such as memory and attention [Source: Curcio et al., 2006]. As students, we need adequate sleep to perform well academically and maintain our mental health.\n\nMoreover, restricting smartphone access after bedtime could enhance our academic performance. The research highlights that improved sleep quality can lead to better cognitive performance, mood regulation, and overall health [Source: Research Report]. By reducing distractions and promoting better sleep, we can focus more effectively on our studies and reduce procrastination, ultimately enhancing our academic outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, establishing boundaries around smartphone use can foster self-discipline and time management skills, which are essential for our personal development. By learning to manage our technology use, we can develop healthier habits that will benefit us in the long term.\n\nIn conclusion, while smartphones are valuable tools, their unrestricted use at bedtime poses significant risks to our sleep quality and academic performance. By implementing restrictions on smartphone access after bedtime, boarding schools can create an environment that supports our well-being and academic success, helping us to become more responsible and well-rounded individuals.\n\nPrincipal: As Principal, my position on the issue of whether boarding schools should take phones after bedtime is firmly in favor of implementing such a policy. This stance is supported by a wealth of research indicating the detrimental effects of smartphone usage on both sleep quality and academic performance among students.\n\nFirstly, the impact of smartphone usage on sleep quality is well-documented. The light emitted from smartphone screens can suppress melatonin production, a hormone essential for regulating sleep-wake cycles, thereby disrupting students' circadian rhythms [Source: Chang et al., 2015]. This disruption is significant, as evidenced by a study where 64.2% of students using smartphones at bedtime were classified as poor sleepers, experiencing increased sleep latency and shorter sleep duration [Source: Al-Mutawa et al., 2022]. Poor sleep quality is directly linked to decreased academic performance due to fatigue and reduced concentration [Source: Samaha & Hawi, 2016].\n\nMoreover, the prevalence of smartphone use at bedtime is alarmingly high, with studies showing that 96.5% of students engage in this behavior, primarily for social media activities [Source: Al-Mutawa et al., 2022]. This widespread usage exacerbates the negative impact on sleep and academic outcomes.\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime has been shown to improve sleep quality and potentially enhance academic performance [Source: Comparative Analysis]. By implementing policies that limit smartphone use during late hours, boarding schools can foster an environment conducive to better sleep hygiene and academic success.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence strongly supports the restriction of smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools to mitigate the adverse effects on students' sleep and academic performance. This approach aligns with our responsibility to promote the well-being and educational achievement of our students.\n\nMom: As a parent, my perspective on the issue of restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools is centered around the holistic development of our children, balancing the benefits of improved sleep with the need for fostering independence and responsibility.\n\nFirstly, I recognize the research indicating that smartphone usage at bedtime can disrupt sleep quality. The blue light emitted by screens can interfere with melatonin production, leading to delayed sleep onset and reduced sleep efficiency [Source: Cajochen et al., 2011]. This disruption can result in shorter sleep duration and increased daytime sleepiness, which are detrimental to cognitive functions such as memory and attention, ultimately affecting academic outcomes [Source: Curcio et al., 2006].\n\nHowever, as a parent, I also believe in the importance of teaching our children to manage their own time and responsibilities. Adolescence is a critical period for developing self-regulation skills, and part of this development involves learning to balance technology use with other life priorities. By allowing students some degree of autonomy over their smartphone usage, we can encourage them to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.\n\nMoreover, while restricting smartphone access might improve sleep quality, it is essential to consider alternative strategies that empower students to adopt healthy sleep habits independently. Educational initiatives that inform students about the effects of screen time on sleep and provide them with tools to manage their technology use can be more effective in the long term [Source: Mindell et al., 2009].\n\nIn conclusion, while there is evidence supporting the restriction of smartphone access after bedtime to enhance sleep and academic performance, it is equally important to foster an environment that encourages personal responsibility and informed decision-making among students.

Abstract

Background

Smartphones are Internet-accessible devices that everyone can use in any setting, and their popularity is growing. However, the pervasiveness of smartphone technology has raised concerns owing to its addictive effect among adolescents and its association with sleep quality and mental and physical health issues.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among secondary high schools in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.

Methods

The study was conducted on high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, using an analytical cross-sectional design, from January 2023 to August 2023. The study used a multistage stratified random sampling technique to select participants. The data were collected from an online self-administered survey and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States).

Results

This study included 373 respondents. Among those, males represent two-thirds of the study population (66%), while females are 34%. The median age of the participants is 16 years old, and the interquartile range (IQR) is 6. Our results show that the median number of hours spent on mobile phones is six per day, and the IQR is 5. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the mean Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) score is 38.5 ± 10.8 out of 60, and the average global PSQI score is 6.63 ± 3.03 out of 21. The results show that the study participants have problems using smartphones longer than they intended, constantly checking them, and missing planned works due to smartphone use. There is a positive correlation between smartphone addiction and sleep quality (r = 0.261; p < 0.001), indicating that the respondents have worse sleep quality when smartphone addiction and the global PSQI increased.

Conclusion

Our study concluded that high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, have high smartphone addiction. Moreover, high smartphone addiction is significantly associated with poor sleep quality. This study can help with the development of measures to improve better sleep quality among high school students.

Introduction

Smartphones are technological devices that significantly impact people's daily lives, changing their habits and behaviors. The utilities and capabilities of these devices are increasing, and the foresight is that this tendency will grow in the following years. However, the problematic use of smartphones has increased dangerously [1]. Many studies demonstrate that smartphone addiction impairs sleep quality [2]. However, the number of studies on Saudi adolescents could be much higher. Indigent darkness in adolescents and young adults can result in long-term sleep problems, which may impact them in adulthood [3]. Young adults today have grown up with smartphones as an evident part of their daily lives [4]. The reason is that the usage of smartphones goes beyond routine calls, allowing one to enjoy games, online shopping, various social interaction activities, and administrative work anytime and anywhere, and has brought us a convenient life [5,6]. Smartphones have also been proven helpful for students as a potential tool to “learn anywhere” [7].

Despite the benefits, smartphone overdependence among adolescents is derived from their developmental characteristics and causes severe psychological, mental, and social problems [8,9]. The overuse of electronic gadgets has been significantly associated with sleeplessness as adolescents spend most of their evening time watching or using electronic media [10].

Sleep is a crucial predictor of general health and well-being, and getting a decent night’s sleep is critical for a person's consistently good physical and mental well-being [11]. The ideal amount of sleep that 13-18-year-old adolescents need is eight to 10 hours [12]. However, children in secondary schools only sleep for a short time [13]. A study in Brazil on 710 adolescents found that 58.06% of subjects who accessed the Internet between 19:00 and 21:00 slept poorly [14]. At present, adolescents aged 10-19 years are growing up immersed in digital media, which has both beneficial and harmful implications for their healthy development [15].

Considering that Saudi Arabia has the highest proportion of smartphone users in the Gulf Cooperation Council [9], this study aims to examine the effects of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among high school students.

Rationale

We are entering a new phenomenon of addiction that might be the most pervasive in human history. While we may not change our habits, at least we can be aware of them to recognize better the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality, especially in the most critical age [16]. The adolescence period is critical for an individual's future, and the rapid development during adolescence indicates that it may be a critical or sensitive period for future health and disease conditions [16]. This is the first research about the impact of smartphone addiction and sleep quality in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, among this age group.

Materials and methods

Study design, setting, and sampling

This analytical cross-sectional study conducted among high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, aimed to determine the impact of smartphone addiction on sleep quality. 

According to the National Ministry of Education, the population size of secondary schools in Makkah is 30,000 [17]. Using Epi Info™ from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia) to calculate the sample size from the cross-sectional study, we found that the expected frequency is 58.7% [2], with a confidence level of 95% and an error percentage of 5%. The ideal sample size was 368. However, we included an additional 15% to account for the clustered design effect and missing data.

A three-stage stratified random sampling technique was adopted. First stage: Makkah has four internal education offices; each education office includes several numbers of schools. Two regions were selected randomly using simple random sampling techniques. Second stage: Two secondary schools were randomly selected in each region using simple random sampling techniques. Third stage: In each school, one class was selected randomly in each education grade using simple random sampling techniques (Figure 1).

Data collection

The data collection used an online self-administrated form filled out by the students using the following tools: socio-demographic questions, including confounding factors that affect sleep quality, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

SAS-SV: It is a valid and reliable Arabic tool [18] that contains 10 items rated on a dimensional scale (1 “strongly disagree” to 6 “strongly agree”). The total score ranges from 10 to 60, with the highest score being the maximum presence of “smartphone addiction” in the past year.

PSQI: It is a valid Arabic translation of the PSQI questionnaire [19]. It consists of 24 questions or items to be rated relating to the behaviors and experiences of the participants in the past month before the survey was conducted (20 items were rated from zero to three, while four were open-ended questions). It was not only developed to quantify sleep quality [20]; the PSQI can also be considered an accepted reference or gold standard for self-perceived sleep quality. In addition, it is the most widely used sleep health assessment tool in both clinical and nonclinical populations [21].

Inclusion Criteria: All Saudi and non-Saudi students enrolled at government and private secondary schools who have a smartphone and live in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, were included in the study.

Exclusion Criteria: Students with special needs, such as blindness, any participants with medical issues that affect sleep, and any participants under medications that can interfere with sleeping, such as first-generation antihistamines, were excluded from the study.

Ethical issues

Informed consent was obtained from each participant to know the purpose, benefits, and risks behind the study before they agreed to join. We considered anonymity and confidentiality; the participants can be in or out of the study at any time: no physical, social, psychological, or all other types of harm incurred. Approval was received from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) Opinion of the Ministry of Health, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, which was reviewed and discussed by the IRB Committee and was approved according to the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines with IRB Number H-02-K-076-0123-883.

Statistical analysis

The data were collected, coded, and cleaned. Data analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Descriptive statistics (i.e., percentage, mean, and standard deviation) were used to summarize the data. Moreover, statistical analysis using the Pearson correlation was applied with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

Characteristics of the participants

A total of 373 subjects were included in this study. About two-thirds of the study participants (n = 246, 66%) are male, and the female respondents are 127 (34%). The median age of the participants is 16 years old, and the interquartile range (IQR) is 6. Our results revealed that the median number of hours spent on mobile phones is six per day, and the IQR is 5. Regarding the educational level of students, three high school academic levels were considered: first year, second year, and third year. We found that most of them are in the second year (n = 153, 41%), while 119 (31.9%) are in the first year and 101 (27.1%) are in the third year. Moreover, we found that most students are enrolled in government schools (n = 324, 86.9%), and only 43 (11.5%) are studying in private schools. In addition, the majority of students follow the general education path (81.5%), 23 (6.2%) follow the course system, 13 (3.5%) are in the standard first year, and 10 (2.7%) follow the computer science and engineering educational path. When we asked about the marital status of the respondents, we found that most of them are single (98.1%), and seven (1.9%) are married. Most of them live with their parents (85.5%), and 43 (11.5%) live with one of their parents. A total of 179 participants (48%) have a monthly family income of less than 5,000 Saudi riyal (SAR), 98 (26.3%) have a monthly family income of more than 10,000 SAR, and 96 (25.7%) have a monthly family income of 5,000-10,000 SAR. Only 65 students (17.4%) have a chronic disease. When we assessed the caffeine intake, we reported that 178 (47.7%) respondents consume caffeine less than six hours before bedtime. Only 105 (28.2%) perform sports activities regularly (Table 1).

Smartphone addiction

Our findings show that the mean SAS-SV score is 38.5 ± 10.8 out of 60. SAS 9 ("Using my smartphone longer than I had intended") and SAS 8 ("Constantly checking my smartphone so as not to miss conversations between other people on Twitter or Facebook") of SAS-SV have higher means (i.e., M = 4.21, SD = 1.43; M = 4.19, SD = 1.52, respectively), followed by SAS 1 ("Missing planned work due to smartphone use") and SAS 4 ("Will not be able to stand not having a smartphone") (i.e., M = 4.05, SD = 1.48; M = 4.04, SD = 1.68, respectively). It indicates that the study participants have a problem using smartphones longer than they intended, constantly checking their smartphones, and missing planned works due to smartphone use (Table 2).

Sleep quality

The average global PSQI score is 6.63 ± 3.03 out of 21. Based on the PSQI, the highest scores in sleep quality components were observed in component 2 (sleep disturbance; M = 1.36, SD = 0.89) and component 7 (sleep medication use; M = 1.36, SD = 0.70), followed by component 5 (sleep efficiency; M = 1.33, SD = 0.648) and component 3 (sleep latency; M = 1.11, SD = 1.08). The lowest scores were achieved by component 4 (daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness; M = 0.24, SD = 0.638) and component 6 (overall sleep quality; M = 0.29, SD = 0.681) (Table 3).

Factors associated with smartphone addiction (SAS-SV score) and sleep quality (PSQI score)

Our results show that the participants who spend a higher number of hours per day on mobile phones and those who have been taking caffeine less than six hours before bedtime are significantly associated with higher smartphone addiction (higher SAS-SV score; p-values < 0.001) and lower sleep quality (higher PSQI score; p-values < 0.001).

Moreover, several factors are significantly associated with higher smartphone addiction (higher SAS-SV score), including female respondents, students who live in other places rather than with their parents, and participants who did not perform a sports activity regularly (p-values = 0.042, 0.036, and 0.003, respectively).

In addition, the respondents who had monthly family income of less than 5,000 SAR were significantly associated with lower sleep quality (higher PSQI score) (p-value = 0.016). Other variables, such as age, educational level, school type, educational path, and marital status, did not show any significant association with smartphone addiction or sleep quality (p-value > 0.05) (Table 4).

 Predictors of sleep quality among the studied students

According to the multivariate regression analysis results, the participants who have a psychiatric disease, take caffeine less than six hours before bedtime, and have higher SAS-SV scores were significantly associated with poor sleep quality (p-values < 0.001). Other factors did not significantly affect sleep quality (p-value > 0.05) (Table 5).

Symptoms during sleep

Our findings show that more than half of the study population have a companion in the same room but not the same bed (n = 217, 58.2%). Moreover, most of the respondents (n = 170, 73.9%) stated that their roommate or bed partner did not observe them make loud snoring during the last month, and only 28 (12.2%) noticed snoring loudly less than once a week. The vast majority of students (n = 188, 81.7%) did not make long pauses between breaths while asleep. Only 41 (17.8%) were observed to experience leg twitching or jerking while they were sleeping less than once a week. In addition, most participants were not noted to have episodes of disorientation, confusion, or restlessness during sleep (above 70%). Twenty-eight (12.2%) had episodes of disorientation or confusion, and 27 (11.7%) experienced restlessness less than once a week during sleep (Table 6).

Discussion

The present study aimed to determine the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among secondary school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Internet addiction and smartphone addiction share many similarities. Based on how Internet addiction is defined, smartphone addiction is the excessive usage of cell phones to the point where it interferes with users’ daily life [22]. There needs to be more research on smartphone addiction, particularly among high school students.

The current study found that the median number of hours spent on mobile phone is six, and the IQR is 5 per day. The study participants have a problem using smartphones longer than they intended, constantly checking their smartphones, and missing planned work due to smartphone use. The results are similar to those in another study conducted in Saudi Arabia: 31.4% of the participants used a smartphone for one to five hours, and 50% (n = 156) used it for six to eight hours [23]. Moreover, our results revealed that the mean SAS-SV score was 38.5 ± 10.8 out of 60. It was relatively lower than that in another study conducted in India, which had a mean SAS score of 85.66 [24]. Another study in Saudi Arabia conducted among medical students showed that 54% of the participants had positive smartphone addiction [25]. Moreover, in our study, the lowest score was noted in the component of daytime dysfunction sleepiness. Daytime sleepiness score was also found to be low in a study conducted in Korea by Chung et al., which also demonstrated the link between daytime sleepiness to gender, alcohol consumption, and poor-self perceived health [26]. The disparities between these studies are most likely due to differences in evaluation systems and the sampled populations. For instance, in Saudi Arabian studies, the population was university students.

In this study, we found a significant positive correlation between smartphone addiction and sleep quality, indicating that the respondents had worse sleep quality when smartphone addiction and the global PSQI increased. It aligns with another study in India that revealed that those who used smartphones excessively had high global PSQI scores [25]. In addition, another study in Korea confirmed our findings and showed that higher S-Scale scores were associated with lower sleep quality [27]. The link between smartphone addiction and sleep quality was also reported in another parallel study in Turkey, in which smartphone addiction was associated with low sleep quality [28]. Moreover, prolonged and excessive smartphone use has been linked to musculoskeletal discomfort [29]. This is consistent with the findings mentioned in another Turkish study, which found an association between smartphone addiction and musculoskeletal pain [30]. Low mood was also found to be significantly associated with smartphone addiction (anxiety and depression) [4]. This finding also correlates with another study conducted by Hernandez et al., in which excessive use of smartphones was linked to the presence of depressive symptoms [31] and difficulty forming social connections [32]. Similar findings were reported in a congruent Australian study [33], which shows that smartphone addiction may impact sleep quality directly or indirectly. An earlier study found that evening exposure to electromagnetic fields affects physiological aspects of sleep and the melatonin cycle, likely by affecting the pineal gland. It may also impact the cerebral blood flow and brain electrical activity [34]. However, another contradictory study found that exposure to an environmental radiofrequency electromagnetic field did not interfere with the self-reported quality of sleep, but no evidence was found on the adverse effects of exposure to the radiofrequency electromagnetic field in our everyday environment on sleep quality [35]. Another study was conducted among undergraduate students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in 2021. A total of 545 undergraduate students, primarily females, aged ≤21 years old, showed that smartphone-addicted students were likely to have a lower GPA, poorer physical health, and severe mental illness than non-addicted students [36]. The differences in findings reported between the two studies could be attributed to different factors, including the studied samples and environmental factors.

Our study faces some limitations: The study employed a cross-sectional design, and hence the identified significant relationships between tested independent variables and the dependent variable (smartphone addiction) cannot be inferred as causal. In addition, the response rate from males was more than that from females, potentially because we collected the data of females during the final examinations. Furthermore, multiple factors can play an essential role in sleep quality, such as psychiatric and chronic diseases, which were not considered in this study [36,37].

Conclusions

Our study concluded that high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, have high smartphone addiction. Moreover, high smartphone addiction is significantly correlated with poor sleep quality. This study can help in the development of measures to improve better sleep quality among high school students.

Recommendations

It is vital to educate students about smartphone addiction and healthy sleep. In clinical applications with issues on poor sleep quality, students' use of smartphones and their addiction to them should be questioned. This study suggests that understanding smartphone addiction among adolescents requires further longitudinal studies to identify the causes of poor sleep quality and raise awareness in adolescents to change their negative behavioral patterns.

However, the pervasiveness of smartphone technology has raised concerns owing to its addictive effect among adolescents and its association with sleep quality and mental and physical health issues.\n\nObjectives\n\nThis study aimed to determine the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among secondary high schools in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMethods\n\nThe study was conducted on high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, using an analytical cross-sectional design, from January 2023 to August 2023. The study used a multistage stratified random sampling technique to select participants. The data were collected from an online self-administered survey and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States).\n\nResults\n\nThis study included 373 respondents. Among those, males represent\xa0two-thirds of the study population (66%), while females are 34%. The median age of the participants is 16 years old, and the interquartile range (IQR) is 6. Our results show that the median number of hours spent on mobile phones is six per day, and the IQR is 5. Furthermore, our findings reveal\xa0that the mean Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version\xa0(SAS-SV) score is 38.5 ± 10.8 out of 60, and the average global PSQI score is 6.63 ± 3.03 out of 21. The results show that the study participants have problems using smartphones longer than they intended, constantly checking them, and missing planned works due to smartphone use. There is a positive correlation between smartphone addiction and sleep quality (r = 0.261; p < 0.001), indicating that the respondents have worse sleep quality when smartphone addiction and the global PSQI increased.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur study concluded that high school students in Makkah,\xa0Saudi Arabia, have high smartphone addiction. Moreover, high\xa0smartphone addiction is significantly associated with poor sleep quality. This study can help with the development of measures to improve better sleep quality among high school students.\n\nKeywords: makkah, high school students, sleep quality, addiction, smartphone\n\nIntroduction\n\nSmartphones are technological devices that significantly impact people\'s daily lives, changing their habits and behaviors. The utilities and capabilities of these devices are increasing, and the foresight is that this tendency will grow in the following years. However, the problematic use of smartphones has increased dangerously [1]. Many studies demonstrate that smartphone addiction impairs sleep quality [2]. However, the number of studies on Saudi adolescents could be much higher. Indigent darkness in adolescents and young adults can result in long-term sleep problems, which may impact them in adulthood [3]. Young adults today have grown up with smartphones as an evident part of their daily lives [4]. The reason is that the usage of smartphones goes beyond routine calls, allowing one to enjoy games, online shopping, various social interaction activities, and administrative work anytime and anywhere, and has brought us a convenient life [5,6]. Smartphones have also been proven helpful for students as a potential tool to “learn anywhere” [7].\n\nDespite the benefits, smartphone overdependence among adolescents is derived from their developmental characteristics and causes severe psychological, mental, and social problems [8,9]. The overuse of electronic gadgets has been significantly associated with sleeplessness as adolescents spend most of their evening time watching or using electronic media [10].\n\nSleep is a crucial predictor of general health and well-being, and getting a decent night’s sleep is critical for a person\'s consistently good physical and mental well-being [11]. The ideal amount of sleep that 13-18-year-old adolescents need is eight to 10 hours [12]. However, children in secondary schools only sleep for a short time [13]. A study in Brazil on 710 adolescents found that 58.06% of subjects who accessed the Internet between 19:00 and 21:00 slept poorly [14]. At present, adolescents aged 10-19 years are growing up immersed in digital media, which has both beneficial and harmful implications for their healthy development [15].\n\nConsidering that Saudi Arabia has the highest proportion of smartphone users in the Gulf Cooperation Council [9], this study aims to examine the effects of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among high school students.\n\nRationale\n\nWe are entering a new phenomenon of addiction that might be the most pervasive in human history. While we may not change our habits, at least we can be aware of them to recognize better the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality, especially in the most critical age [16]. The adolescence period is critical for an individual\'s future, and the rapid development during adolescence indicates that it may be a critical or sensitive period for future health and disease conditions [16]. This is the first research about the impact of smartphone addiction and sleep quality in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, among this age group.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy design, setting, and sampling\n\nThis analytical cross-sectional study conducted among high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, aimed to determine the impact of smartphone addiction on sleep quality.\xa0\n\nAccording to the National Ministry of Education, the population size of secondary schools in Makkah is 30,000 [17]. Using Epi Info™ from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia) to calculate the sample size from the cross-sectional study, we found that the expected frequency is 58.7% [2], with a confidence level of 95% and an error percentage of 5%. The ideal sample size was 368. However, we included an additional 15% to account for the clustered design effect and missing data.\n\nA three-stage stratified random sampling technique was adopted. First stage: Makkah has four internal education offices; each education office includes several numbers of schools. Two regions were selected randomly using simple random sampling techniques. Second stage: Two secondary schools were randomly selected in each region using simple random sampling techniques. Third stage: In each school, one class was selected randomly in each education grade using simple random sampling techniques (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Flow chart of the sampling technique .\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nData collection\n\nThe data collection used an online self-administrated form filled out by the students using the following tools: socio-demographic questions, including confounding factors that affect sleep quality, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n\nSAS-SV: It is a valid and reliable Arabic tool [18] that contains 10 items rated on a dimensional scale (1 “strongly disagree” to 6 “strongly agree”). The total score ranges from 10 to 60, with the highest score being the maximum presence of “smartphone addiction” in the past year.\n\nPSQI: It is a valid Arabic translation of the PSQI questionnaire [19]. It consists of 24 questions or items to be rated relating to the behaviors and experiences of the participants in the past month before the survey was conducted (20 items were rated from zero to three, while four were open-ended questions). It was not only developed to quantify sleep quality [20]; the PSQI can also be considered an accepted reference or gold standard for self-perceived sleep quality. In addition, it is the most widely used sleep health assessment tool in both clinical and nonclinical populations [21].\n\nInclusion Criteria: All Saudi and non-Saudi students enrolled at government and private secondary schools who have a smartphone and live in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, were included in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria: Students with special needs, such as blindness, any participants with medical issues that affect sleep, and any participants under medications that can interfere with sleeping, such as first-generation antihistamines, were excluded from the study.\n\nEthical issues\n\nInformed consent was obtained from each participant to know the purpose, benefits, and risks behind the study before they agreed to join. We considered anonymity and confidentiality; the participants can be in or out of the study at any time: no physical, social, psychological, or all other types of harm incurred. Approval was received from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) Opinion of the Ministry of Health, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, which was reviewed and discussed by the IRB Committee and was approved according to the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines with IRB Number H-02-K-076-0123-883.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe data were collected, coded, and cleaned. Data analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Descriptive statistics (i.e., percentage, mean, and standard deviation) were used to summarize the data. Moreover, statistical analysis using the Pearson correlation was applied with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nCharacteristics of the participants\n\nA total of 373 subjects were included in this study. About two-thirds of the study participants (n = 246, 66%) are male, and the female respondents are 127 (34%). The median age of the participants is 16 years old, and the interquartile range (IQR) is 6. Our results revealed that the median number of hours spent on mobile phones is six per day, and the IQR is 5. Regarding the educational level of students, three high school academic levels were considered: first year, second year, and third year. We found that most of them are in the second year (n = 153, 41%), while 119 (31.9%) are in the first year and 101 (27.1%) are in the third year. Moreover, we found that most students are enrolled in government schools (n = 324, 86.9%), and only 43 (11.5%) are studying in private schools. In addition, the majority of students follow\xa0the general education\xa0path (81.5%), 23 (6.2%) follow\xa0the course system, 13 (3.5%) are in the standard first year, and 10 (2.7%) follow\xa0the computer science and engineering educational path.\xa0When we asked about the marital status of the respondents, we found that most of them are\xa0single (98.1%), and seven (1.9%) are married. Most of them live with their parents (85.5%), and 43 (11.5%) live with one of their parents. A total of 179 participants (48%) have a monthly family income of less than 5,000 Saudi riyal (SAR), 98 (26.3%) have a monthly family income of more than 10,000 SAR, and 96 (25.7%) have a monthly family income of 5,000-10,000 SAR. Only 65 students (17.4%) have a chronic disease. When we assessed the caffeine intake, we reported that 178 (47.7%) respondents consume caffeine less than six hours before bedtime. Only 105 (28.2%) perform sports activities regularly (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.

SAS 9 ("Using my smartphone longer than I had intended") and SAS 8 ("Constantly checking my smartphone so as not to miss conversations between other people on Twitter or Facebook") of SAS-SV have higher means (i.e., M = 4.21, SD = 1.43; M = 4.19, SD = 1.52, respectively), followed by SAS 1 ("Missing planned work due to smartphone use") and SAS 4 ("Will not be able to stand not having a smartphone") (i.e., M = 4.05, SD = 1.48; M = 4.04, SD = 1.68, respectively). It indicates that the study participants have a problem using smartphones longer than they intended, constantly checking their smartphones, and missing planned works due to smartphone use (Table 2).\n\nTable 2.

Based on the PSQI, the highest scores in sleep quality components were observed in component 2 (sleep disturbance; M = 1.36, SD = 0.89) and component 7 (sleep medication use; M = 1.36, SD = 0.70), followed by component 5 (sleep efficiency; M = 1.33, SD = 0.648) and component 3 (sleep latency; M = 1.11, SD = 1.08). The lowest scores were achieved by component 4 (daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness; M = 0.24, SD = 0.638) and component 6 (overall sleep quality; M = 0.29, SD = 0.681) (Table 3).\n\nTable 3.

Other variables, such as age, educational level, school type, educational path, and marital status, did not show any significant association with smartphone addiction or sleep quality (p-value > 0.05) (Table 4).\n\nTable 4.

The vast majority of students (n = 188, 81.7%) did not make long pauses between breaths while asleep. Only 41 (17.8%) were observed to experience leg twitching or jerking while they were sleeping less than once a week. In addition, most participants were not noted to have episodes of disorientation, confusion, or restlessness during sleep (above 70%). Twenty-eight (12.2%) had episodes of disorientation or confusion, and 27 (11.7%) experienced restlessness less than once a week during sleep (Table 6).\n\nTable 6.

Internet addiction and smartphone addiction share many similarities. Based on how Internet addiction is defined, smartphone addiction is the excessive usage of cell phones to the point where it interferes with users’ daily life [22]. There needs to be more research on smartphone addiction, particularly among high school students.\n\nThe current study found that the median number of hours spent on mobile phone is six, and the IQR is 5 per day. The study participants have a problem using smartphones longer than they intended, constantly checking their smartphones, and missing planned work due to smartphone use. The results are similar to those in another study conducted in Saudi Arabia: 31.4% of the participants used a smartphone for one to five hours, and 50% (n = 156) used it for six to eight hours [23]. Moreover, our results revealed that the mean SAS-SV score was 38.5 ± 10.8 out of 60. It was relatively lower than that in another study conducted in India, which had a mean SAS score of 85.66 [24]. Another study in Saudi Arabia conducted among medical students showed that 54% of the participants had positive smartphone addiction [25]. Moreover, in our study, the lowest score was noted in the component of daytime dysfunction sleepiness. Daytime sleepiness score was also found to be low in a study conducted in Korea by Chung et al., which also demonstrated the link between daytime sleepiness to gender, alcohol consumption, and poor-self perceived health [26]. The\xa0disparities between these studies are most likely due to differences in evaluation systems and the sampled populations. For instance, in Saudi Arabian studies, the population was university students.\n\nIn this study, we found a significant positive correlation between smartphone addiction and sleep quality, indicating that the respondents had worse sleep quality when smartphone addiction and the global PSQI increased. It aligns with another study in\xa0India that revealed that those who used smartphones excessively had high global PSQI scores [25]. In addition, another study in Korea confirmed our findings and showed that higher S-Scale scores were associated with lower sleep quality [27]. The link between smartphone addiction and sleep quality was also reported in another parallel study in Turkey, in which smartphone addiction was associated with low sleep quality [28]. Moreover, prolonged and excessive smartphone use has been linked to musculoskeletal discomfort [29]. This is consistent with the findings mentioned in another Turkish study, which found an association between smartphone addiction and musculoskeletal pain [30]. Low mood was also found to be significantly associated with smartphone addiction (anxiety and depression) [4]. This finding also correlates with another study conducted by Hernandez et al., in which excessive use of smartphones was linked to the presence of depressive symptoms [31] and difficulty forming social connections [32]. Similar findings were reported in a congruent Australian study [33], which shows that smartphone addiction may impact sleep quality directly or indirectly. An earlier study found that evening exposure to electromagnetic fields affects physiological aspects of sleep and the melatonin cycle, likely by affecting the pineal gland. It may also impact the cerebral blood flow and brain electrical activity [34]. However, another contradictory study found that exposure to an environmental radiofrequency electromagnetic field did not interfere with the self-reported quality of sleep, but no evidence was found on the adverse effects of exposure to the radiofrequency electromagnetic field in our everyday environment on sleep quality [35]. Another study was conducted among undergraduate students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in 2021. A total of 545 undergraduate students, primarily females, aged ≤21 years old, showed that smartphone-addicted students were likely to have a lower GPA, poorer physical health, and severe mental illness than non-addicted students [36]. The differences in findings reported between the two studies could be attributed to different factors, including the studied samples and environmental factors.\n\nOur study faces some limitations: The study employed a cross-sectional design, and hence the identified significant relationships between tested independent variables and the dependent variable (smartphone addiction) cannot be inferred as causal. In addition, the response rate from males was more than that from females, potentially because we collected the data of females during the final examinations. Furthermore, multiple factors can play an essential role in sleep quality, such as psychiatric and chronic diseases, which were not considered in this study [36,37].\n\nConclusions\n\nOur study concluded that high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, have high smartphone addiction. Moreover, high\xa0smartphone addiction is significantly correlated with poor sleep quality. This study can help in the development of measures to improve better sleep quality among high school students.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is vital to educate students about smartphone addiction and healthy sleep. In clinical applications with issues on poor sleep quality, students\' use of smartphones and their addiction to them should be questioned. This study suggests that understanding smartphone addiction among adolescents requires further longitudinal studies to identify the causes of poor sleep quality and raise awareness in adolescents to change their negative behavioral patterns.\n\nAppendices\nFigure 2.

Abstract

Due to the high incidence of smartphone addiction and its harmful effects on health in recent years, it has received widespread attention from society. This study aims to examine the association between smartphone addiction and sleep quality among college students, and assess the correlation with physical exercise in a non-interventional, cross-sectional study design. The study utilized data from the 2022 Chinese College Health Tracking Survey. A total of 4670 students participated in and completed the questionnaire. The test tools comprised the smartphone addiction tendency scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the physical activity rating scale. The average score of the college students’ smartphone addiction was 39.230±14.931, and the proportion of college students with average and or very poor sleep quality was 52.6%. Mobile phone addiction among college students is negatively correlated with physical exercise (r = -0.101, p<0.01), and positively correlated with sleep quality (r = 0.287, p<0.01. Physical exercise had a significant regulatory effect on the behavior relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality (ΔR2 = 0.194, p<0.001). Smartphone addiction has a significant impact on college students’ sleep quality. The higher the tendency towards smartphone addiction, the poorer the sleep quality of college students. Physical exercise plays a regulatory role in the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality of college students.

1. Introduction

Mobile phone addiction refers to a new type of behavioral addiction in which individuals overuse smartphones to an uncontrollable extent, causing psychological, behavioral, and other problems to people [1]. According to the 51st Statistical Report on Internet Development in China, the number of Chinese netizens has reached 1.067 billion as of December 2022, of which young people aged 20–29 accounted for 14.2% [2]. With the improvement of living standards, electronic products such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops are increasingly used in the daily lives of Chinese college students. Students have spent more time in contact with smartphones due to online classes under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic [3, 4]. At the same time, the development of technology also made electronic products such as smartphones more portable and convenient to access the internet, and the vast social world behind it often attracts college students to immerse themselves in the electronic virtual world [5].

In discussing the relationship between smartphone addiction and the sleep quality of college students, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of their stage in emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood is a key developmental phase that involves the transition from adolescence to adulthood, during which individuals experience extended engagement in higher education, increased tolerance for premarital sex and cohabitation, and later ages of entering marriage and parenthood [6]. These changes grant them a self-focused freedom from role obligations and constraints, and satisfaction in progressing towards self-sufficiency [7]. However, the high degree of freedom and low societal role obligations at this stage may result in insufficient self-regulation in smartphone use. Excessive reliance on smartphones can not only impact their quality of life but may also lead to the development of mental health issues such as depressive symptoms and anxiety [8]. Therefore, devising effective intervention measures to reduce the negative impact of smartphone addiction is crucial for safeguarding the mental and physical health development of college students.

College students have more leisure time compared to adolescents and adults due to their special growth stage, making them a high-risk group for smartphone addiction. A study in Saudi Arabia found that the longer the use of smartphones, the deeper the dependence on it [9]. The media dependency theory also indicates that the longer the use of the media, the greater the impact it has on its users [10].

The correct use of smartphones can provide great convenience to college students’ study and life, but excessive addiction to smartphone use not only reduces sleep quality but also generates negative emotions, such as fatigue and procrastination [11, 12]. Some studies have shown that the harm caused by smartphone addiction mainly includes physical problems such as headaches, blurred vision, and neck pain [13]. On the one hand, smartphone addiction can reduce the time college students spend on physical exercise, thereby decreasing their physical fitness. On the other hand, excessive use of smartphones can lead to poor sleep quality among students. A study by Orzech found that more than 72.9% of college students use smartphones for more than one hour before going to bed [14]. Pham’s research also indicated that pre-sleep smartphone addiction has become an important factor affecting the sleep quality of college students [15]. Therefore, exploring the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality among college students is greatly significant for their physical and mental health development.

Sleep plays an important role in the development of physical and psychological functions as part of a healthy lifestyle. Positive sleep quality is one of the necessary conditions for the development of individuals’ physiological and psychological functions [16]. However, smartphone addiction is one of the most important factors that has a negative impact on sleep quality [17]. As the main force of future development of the world, college students’ healthy development is related to the future of the world to some extent. Physical exercise is only considered as a measure to improve sleep quality, but few studies have explored the intrinsic relationship among smartphone addiction, sleep quality, and physical exercise. Early studies have indicated a significant correlation between smartphone addiction and a decline in sleep quality. For instance, researchers from Saudi Arabia have found that excessive smartphone use is associated with poor sleep quality [18]. A study from China has also revealed the negative impact of smartphone addiction on academic performance [19]. Additionally, there are studies indicating that smartphone addiction has a negative impact on sleep quality among the elderly population [20]. However, there is a lack of comprehensive perspective in the literature regarding how the level of physical activity might modulate this relationship.

In addition to the direct impacts related to smartphone addiction, physical activity is another important health behavioral factor that has been proven to positively correlate with sleep quality. Nonetheless, the interaction between smartphone addiction, physical activity levels, and sleep quality has not been fully explored in previous research. The intent of our study is to bridge this knowledge gap, with a particular focus on the unique population context in China. As one of the world’s largest markets for smartphones, understanding the specific circumstances of this region is crucial for a deeper comprehension and addressing of global health concerns. This study takes college students as the research object, and taking smartphone addiction and sleep quality as entry points and introducing physical exercise as a moderating variable (as shown in Fig 1). This study aims to explore the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality under the regulation of physical exercise. The primary objectives of this study are as follows:(1)To describe the patterns and extent of smartphone addiction, sleep quality, and physical exercise among Chinese college students.(2)To investigate the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality in college students.(3)To examine the role of physical exercise as a potential moderating mediator in the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality in college students.

2.2 Measurement methods
2.2.1 Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS)

This study used the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS) to measure mobile phone addiction among university students, which was compiled by Chinese scholars Xiong et al. [23]. MPATS comprises four dimensions: withdrawal symptoms, salience, social comfort, and mood changes, with a total of 16 items. Each item is scored using a five-point Likert scale: “completely not applicable,” “somewhat not applicable,” “neutral,” “somewhat applicable,” and “completely applicable,” for which the scores range from 1 to 5. The highest score is 80, and the lowest is 16. A higher score indicates a greater tendency for mobile phone addiction, while a lower score indicates a lower tendency. The factor loadings of the four dimensions range from 0.51 to 0.79, with an overall variance explained of 54.3%. The confirmatory factor analysis results show the applicability of the four-factor model. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the total scale was 0.83, and the coefficients of the four factors ranged from 0.55 to 0.80. The test-retest reliability of the total scale was 0.91, while that of the four factors ranged from 0.75 to 0.85 [23]. The scale belongs to categorical variables.

2.2.2 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)

The sleep quality of the university students was measured by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI was compiled by Dr. Buysse, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh, along with others in 1989. The PSQI is suitable for the evaluation of sleep quality and therapeutic efficacy observation of sleep disorder patients and mental disorder patients, investigation and study of sleep quality of general population, and the evaluation tool for the study of the correlation between sleep quality and psychosomatic health. The scale is more suitable for use by the Chinese population after Liu’s revisions. The scale comprises 23 items and is divided into seven components, each of which is scored on a scale of 0–3. The cumulative score of each component is the total PSQI score, which ranges from 0 to 21. The higher the total score, the worse the sleep quality becomes. The criteria for the total score are as follows: a score of 0–4 indicates good sleep quality, 5–7 indicates average sleep quality, and 8–21 indicates poor sleep quality [24]. The scale has good reliability and validity, with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.764 [24]. The scale belongs to categorical variables.

2.2.3 Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3)

The Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3) was compiled by Japanese scholar Hiroo Hashimoto and revised by Chinese scholar Liang [25, 26]. The scale consists of three items, and each question in the scale is divided into five levels, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. The total score is highest at 100 and lowest at 0. with 0 indicating no physical activity and 100 indicating maximum physical activity. The score criteria are as follows: low exercise level (≤19 points), moderate exercise level (20–42 points), and high exercise level (≥43 points) [25]. The PARS-3 results are a measure of sports activities and can reflect the behavioral state of college students’ participation in sports at a specific time to some extent. Domestic research shows that the internal consistency reliability coefficient of the scale is 0.856, while the retest reliability coefficient is 0.820 [25]. The scale belongs to categorical variables.

2.3 Statistical analysis

Data processing was conducted by using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 and WPS Excel software(11.1.0.14309), which consisted of the following four steps: (1) Use Excel software to preprocess the data obtained from the questionnaire, and retest or delete the missing or problematic data. (2) After preprocessing the data, conduct a general analysis of the collected student data. The analysis content comprises sleep quality and physical exercise status. The Chi-square test was used to analyze the differences in physical exercise and sleep quality among students of different genders and grades. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences between sleep quality and physical exercise in male and female university students of various grades based on the effect size, η2. (3) A correlation analysis was performed to examine the correlation between the tendency of mobile phone addiction among university students (including withdrawal symptoms, highlight behavior, social comfort, and mood changes) and physical exercise, as well as sleep quality. (4) A linear regression analysis was used to test the effect of mobile phone addiction on sleep quality among university students, with physical exercise included as a moderating variable. Before calculating the moderation effect, the variables (Z-score) were standardized.

3. Research findings
3.1 General trends

Table 2 shows that the proportion of male students who engaged in moderate (21.4%) and high levels (25.3%) of physical exercise was much higher than that of female students who engaged in moderate (9.5%) and high levels (4.9%) of physical exercise. Moreover, there was a significant difference in physical exercise between male and female students (p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.365). From a grade perspective, a significant difference exists in physical exercise among university students in different grades (p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.080). The number of freshmen who had good sleep quality (52.4%) was significantly higher than that of students in other grades. No significant difference exists in sleep quality between male and female students (p = 0.240, Cramer’s V = 0.400), but a significant difference exists in sleep quality among university students in different grades (p <0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.770).

3.3 Test for moderating effects

Table 5 presents the results of the effect of sports exercise regulation. Model 1 shows that with sleep quality as the dependent variable, the explanation rate of independent mobile addiction and regulating sports exercise variables is 18.9%. In Model 2, the predictive ability improved by 19.4%, meaning that the contribution rate of regulating effect is 19.4% under the condition that mobile addiction independent variable and sports exercise regulation variable remain unchanged. In addition, the significant F change in both models is less than 0.001. The mobile addiction independent variable and sports exercise regulation variable have a significant impact on the sleep quality dependent variable. In the analysis of variance, the P value is less than 0.001, indicating that the regulatory effect of sports exercise regulation variable on the mobile addiction independent variable is significant. Therefore, sports exercise is a regulatory factor for mobile addiction and sleep quality.

4. Discussion

Sleep quality is becoming increasingly important for people’s physical health in today’s fast-paced life. The research object of this paper is Chinese college students. Through the investigation and analysis of their data, we explore the internal relationship among smartphone addiction, sleep quality and physical exercise. The score of smartphone addiction among university students is 39.23±14.93. Approximately 51.9% of university students have average or poor sleep quality. Smartphone addiction among university students is negatively correlated with physical exercise and positively correlated with sleep quality. Physical exercise has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality. Smartphone addiction among university students has a significant impact on sleep quality. The higher the tendency of smartphone addiction, the poorer the sleep quality of university students. Physical exercise plays a moderating role in the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality among university students.

4.1 Analysis of the variability in physical exercise among college students

The proportion of male university students with moderate and high exercise levels is much higher than that of female university students. This is consistent with the findings of a previous study from the United States. Trevor Egli MS determined that the main factors driving exercise motivation among American male college students are strength, competition, and challenge, while the main factors driving exercise motivation among American female college students are weight management and appearance [27]. We believe that the reason for this phenomenon in China may be that the exercise motivations of different genders of college students have changed. Chinese male university students engage in moderate and high exercise levels more often, to pursue strength, competition and challenge, and thus most of them choose high-intensity exercise. The feudal society in China for thousands of years has given women the stereotypical label of quiet, gentle and peaceful, which has not been completely removed. Today, the aesthetic pursuit of women in China is based on to be thin for beauty, wherein more female university students engage in low-intensity aerobic exercise to maintain their beauty of body shape, which may be the reason why there are differences in physical exercise among Chinese university students based on gender.

This study found that there were significant differences in physical exercise among university students in different grades. This is consistent with Wu’s research [28], which found that senior students face with graduation and future career or study planning, and can only spend less time on physical exercise. The proportion of students in the first year engaging in moderate and high levels of exercise was slightly higher than that of students in the second, third, and fourth years. However, the proportion of freshmen was significantly lower than that of sophomore, junior, and senior students in terms of low-intensity exercise. We believe that the reasons for this phenomenon may be related to the education system in Chinese universities. students in the first year have less academic pressure and apart from the daily class time, they have no worries about other things. They have sufficient time for physical exercise without worrying about the lack of physical and mental strength which will affect other affairs. However, in the second, third, and fourth years, students not only face academic pressure, but the pressure of future career planning, further education and other aspects, which make them begin to use their extracurricular time to make up for their deficiencies. Therefore, students turn to low-intensity exercise to minimize physical exertion. In fourth year, the proportion of students engaging in moderate and high levels of exercise is higher than that of the second and third years. The reason for this may be that some fourth-year students have found jobs or obtained qualifications for further education, leading to an increase in the proportion of students engaging in moderate and high levels of exercise. This pressure is particularly prominent during the pandemic [29]. Additionally, it is crucial to understand that university students in China are in a critical evolutionary phase of transitioning from adolescence to adulthood, a period characterized by significant psychological and lifestyle changes [30]. This transition phase influences not only their academic and professional choices but also impacts their psychological well-being and daily behaviors including exercise habits. Undergraduate education in Chinese universities lasts only for four years (except for medical majors), and three out of the four years of college students enrolled in 2019 have been affected by the pandemic. Their schools cannot guarantee normal teaching, which leads to a lack of solid mastery of professional knowledge and skills, greatly increasing the students’ pressure for the future. Therefore, most sophomore and junior students chose low-intensity exercise to ensure that they have sufficient time and energy to study.

4.2 Analysis of the differences in sleep quality among college students

This study determined that 51.9% of Chinese university students had problems with sleep quality. This is consistent with Hu’s research result, which found that more than half of the sample had sleep problems [31]. According to previous studies, long-term use of mobile phones and less physical exercise may be associated with poor sleep quality among university students [32].WANG suggested that university students’ sleep quality is susceptible to different risk factors, and the main determinants need to be considered when designing interventions to improve their sleep quality [33]. The university students’ sleep quality can be affected by various factors, and with the development of technology, smartphone addiction has gradually become an important factor affecting university students’ sleep quality [34]. This study mainly explores the influence of smartphone addiction on university students’ sleep quality, and smartphone addiction is considered as the main risk factor to investigate. Elizabeth B. Dowdell reported that a quarter of college students have a habit of using smartphones before sleep, which is associated with memory decline. Moreover, the trend of using smartphones before sleep shows an increasing tendency among college students [35]. Bartel, K study also mentioned that restricting the use of mobile phones in young people would enable them to sleep longer and have higher sleep quality [36]. All aforementioned studies have proved that smartphone addiction has an impact on sleep quality.

No significant gender differences exist in sleep quality among university students. This is different from previous studies where gender differences were found to play an important role in sleep quality, with higher sleep problem rates among females [37]. However, Zhang’s research found that sleep quality among East Asian women was better than that of women in other regions of the world [38]. This phenomenon may be related to cross-regional cultural differences. In terms of grade level, the sleep quality of freshmen was significantly better than that of students in the other three grades, which is related to the education system in China. In high school, Chinese students face heavy academic pressure, and the prevalence of sleep problems among Chinese high school students was 42.3%, according to Cao’s research [39]. However, in university, the decrease in academic pressure in the first year leads to an increase in students’ sleep time and improvement in sleep quality. However, students begin to consider their own development and future plans starting from second year, and the increasing pressure forces them to sacrifice more time in academic and skill learning. Therefore, from the data, it can be observed that the proportion of university students with poor sleep quality decreased significantly from first to third year. The reason for the improvement in sleep quality of senior students is that some of them have already found jobs with graduation approaching, and they no longer have to worry about academic and graduation pressures. Therefore, the sleep quality of students in this phase begins to improve.

4.3 Analysis of the variability in mobile phone addiction among college students

No significant difference exists in mobile phone addiction between students of different genders. This is different from previous studies which indicated that females are more susceptible to mobile phone addiction [40, 41]. However, no difference exists in this paper. The possible reason for this may be that the epidemic has led to a decrease in the entertainment methods of college students. Frequent online classes, school closures and dormitory lockdowns have forced college students to spend more time indoors [42]. During this period, mobile phones became the most convenient way for communication and entertainment for students, regardless of their gender, which led to the result that no difference exists in mobile phone addiction between male and female students in this study.

A significantly positive correlation exists between the four dimensions of mobile phone addiction in college students (withdrawal symptoms, salience, social comfort, and mood changes) and their sleep quality scores. A higher score on the PSQI represents lower sleep quality, which means that the higher the degree of mobile phone addiction among college students, the worse their sleep quality would be, which is consistent with the findings of Fengd’s study [43]. From December 2019 to December 2022, under the impact of COVID-19, China implemented normalized prevention and control policies, which forced many universities to adopt online teaching measures once positive cases were found in the cities where they were located. If students were in close contact with positive cases on campus, they had to undergo a seven-day home quarantine. In quarantine, smartphones became their only means of communication and information acquisition with the outside world. Social interaction is a universal basic human motivation [44]. Saadeh and H’s research investigation found that 85% of people in quarantine increased their mobile phone usage during the isolation period, with 42% using their phones for more than 6 hours per day [45]. Long-term quarantine can provide strong psychological pressure. Therefore, in long-term medical isolation situations, corresponding measures must be taken to ensure the psychological health of the quarantined individuals, avoiding negative mental problems. Previous studies have shown that sleep quality is influenced by many factors, such as lifestyle, environmental factors, work conditions, social life, economic conditions, physical health status, stress, and so on [46]. Mobile phone addiction, as an environmental factor, has a negative impact on sleep quality [47–49], which is consistent with the results of the correlation analysis in this study. Poor sleep quality can lead to depression and stress [50], affecting the health of college students in a significant negative way [51, 52]. Therefore, Chinese universities should take measures to reduce the use of smartphones by students.

4.4 Correlation discussion

A significantly negative correlation exists between the total score of college students’ physical exercise level and their sleep quality, indicating that physical exercise may improve college students’ sleep quality [53, 54]. In Dolezal’s study, regardless of the type and intensity of physical activity, exercise can improve subjective sleep quality [54]. Physical exercise promotes the college students’ physical and mental health. Severe mobile phone addiction is a psychological illness, and physical exercise has a significant positive impact on psychological improvement [55]. Physical exercise can reduce the impact of psychological stress on emotional states, promote emotional health [56], and provide a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Through physical exercise, college students can increase knowledge, develop skills, and feel a sense of fulfillment [57], which can enable them to focus their attention on real-life rather than seeking fulfillment in the virtual world.

4.5 Moderating effect discussion

Through the analysis of the moderating effect, physical exercise has a significant moderating effect on the impact of mobile phone addiction on college students’ sleep quality. From a physiological perspective, the long-term use of smartphones by college students increases the amount of microwave radiation that the body receives. The central nervous system is the most sensitive target for microwave radiation. Therefore, microwave radiation’s impact on the human body is primarily through the nervous system [58]. The main cause of neurasthenia syndrome caused by electromagnetic radiation from smartphones is long-term close contact with the body [59]. This may be the reason why sleep quality is affected by mobile phone addiction. However, an explosion of information exists in today’s society, and smartphones are the most economical, convenient, and fastest way for college students to obtain external information. Continuous theory holds that the brain’s mental activity is continuous, and dreams at night unconsciously reflect daytime activity [60]. It is also important to consider that university students are in a crucial developmental phase transitioning from adolescence to adulthood, characterized by significant psychological and lifestyle changes. This transition not only influences their academic and career choices but also their sleep patterns and behaviors, including smartphone use [61]. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the most common information college students obtained through short videos was related to the epidemic, increasing their anxiety. Therefore, prolonged use of smartphones can cause college students to unconsciously recall the information they searched for about the epidemic during the day [62], which is also one of the reasons for poor sleep quality in college students. Understanding the developmental stage of university students can provide additional context to analyze how factors like smartphone addiction impact their sleep quality.

The significant moderating effect of physical exercise on sleep quality in college students may be due to the following reasons: (1) When college students engage in physical exercise, they reduce the time of using smartphones, which reduces the impact of microwave radiation on their central nervous system [58]. (2) Through physical exercise, college students gain a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction, reducing their need to seek fulfillment in the virtual world of smartphones [63]. (3) Physical exercise can release the stress that college students experience in their studies and daily life, thus improving their sleep quality [64].

The limitations of this study comprise the following: (1) Mobile phone addiction is caused by multiple factors, and there are many interfering factors in the exploration process. The impact of each variable must be explored through quasi-experimental and longitudinal studies, which can be future research directions. (2) The scope of the investigation needs to be further expanded, and the research subjects should be representative to verify the universality and rationality of this study. (3) This study only discusses the impact mechanism of physical exercise on mobile phone addiction and sleep quality, without delving into the discussion of causal relationships. (4) The study did not collect information on participant characteristics and potential confounding factors during data collection, which is a limitation of this study.

5. Conclusion

The proportion of university students with sleep quality problems is 51.9%, which may be related to the degree of mobile phone addiction. The proportion of male university students who engage in moderate and high levels of exercise is much higher than that of female university students, and this phenomenon may be due to differences in exercise motivation. Mobile phone addiction among university students is negatively correlated with physical exercise and positively correlated with sleep quality. The more severe the mobile phone addiction among university students, the worse their sleep quality would be. Physical exercise can significantly regulate the adverse effects of mobile phone addiction on sleep quality among university students. Although the sample size of this study is concentrated in a single school, the students admitted to this school come from different provinces and regions. Therefore, there are variations in lifestyle habits and practices, which to some extent reduces the limitations of the study. The data can provide theoretical support for improving the sleep quality of university students.

5. Review Comments to the Author

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: 1.Your English writing needs further improvement. The language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous.

2.Your paper layout needs further beautification. For example, formula (1) is too large for the paper.

Reviewer #2: Thank you for giving me the opportunity for this review.

This study examined the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality in a single university in China, taking into account exercise behavior. Smartphone addiction is an emerging social issue and this study deals with an important public health topic.

While the results presented are common sense and valid, the quality of this study is low and the data does not seem to corroborate the results presented with a high degree of accuracy.

There are several major issues with this study. First, this is a cross-sectional study, and the study design does not allow for reference to causal relationships. Second, the study participants were students affiliated with a single university, making the study less representative. Third, the analysis only identified simple correlations and did not adjust for several potential confounders.

Participants

1. The authors should provide an overview of Nantong University so that readers can assess representativeness.

2. The authors should describe the study participants in detail, including in the text and a table.

3. The authors should provide an in-depth discussion of one of the major limitations of this study, representativeness, in the discussion section.

4. I did not understand the description of the sample size calculation method.

Measurement Methods

5. The authors should provide a table of data on study participant characteristics, such as obesity rate, smoking and alcohol consumption rates, and potential confounders that may influence the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep, such as academic achievement, financial ability, commuting time to university, and living environment, if they measured these factors.

6. If the authors did not have access to the characteristics and potential confounders of the study participants, this should be noted in the discussion section as a limitation of the study.

7. The authors should cite the original article on the physical activity assessment study.

Statistical Analysis

8. The authors should adjust for confounders using multivariable analysis methods.

Reviewer #3: In this study, the authors investigate the influence of smartphone addiction on the sleep quality of college students: the regulatory effect of physical exercise behavior. The study draws attention with its sample size. My concerns about the study are listed below.

As the authors know, there are many studies conducted in this area (33. Sahin S, Ozdemir K, Unsal A, Temiz N. Evaluation of mobile phone addiction level and sleep quality in university students. Pak J Med Sci. 2013;29(4):913-8. doi: 10.12669/pjms.294.3686. PubMed PMID: WOS:000322619000005.)

More up-to-date resources in WOS could have been used (Buke, M., Egesoy, H., & Unver, F. (2021). The effect of smartphone addiction on physical activity level in sports science undergraduates. Journal of bodywork and movement therapies, 28, 530-534).

The concept of hypothesis is misused. H1-H2-H3 were questions that the authors sought answers to.

Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS) and Physical Activity 151 Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3) should be included in the summary.

Spelling and punctuation in the text should be checked. Use the dot after the closed parenthesis.

Dear Editors and Reviewers:

Thank you for your letter and the reviewer’s comments regarding our manuscript, “Influence of Smartphone Addiction on Sleep Quality of College Students: The Regulatory Effect of Physical Exercise Behavior”(PONE-D-23-21239).These comments have been invaluable and helpful in revising and improving our paper, as well as important guidance for our research. We have carefully studied these comments and made revisions, which we hope will be recognized. The revised parts are highlighted in red in the paper. The corrections in the paper and the responses to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:

Reviewer #1: 

1.Your English writing needs further improvement. The language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous.

Response:We recognize your concern for the clarity and correctness of our English writing. We apologize for any ambiguities or errors that may have occurred. As a result, we have sought the assistance of a professional academic editing agency to ensure the accuracy and fluency of the language in this revision. We will be working closely with them to meticulously proofread and revise the paper.Thank you for your suggestion, and we will strive to ensure the language quality of the paper, as evidenced by the proof of editing provided below.

2.Your paper layout needs further beautification. For example, formula (1) is too large for the paper.

Response:We appreciate your feedback on the layout of our paper. We understand that the font size of Equation (1) is too large, making the article aesthetically unappealing. We will carefully adjust the font size and formatting to ensure that all formulas and charts are visually appealing while maintaining readability. Thank you for your suggestion, and we will strive to make improvements accordingly.

Reviewer #2：

1.This is a cross-sectional study, and the study design does not allow for reference to causal relationships.

Response:Thank you for your review and valuable feedback on our research titled "Influence of Smartphone Addiction on Sleep Quality of College Students: The Regulatory Effect of Physical Exercise Behavior" We greatly appreciate your comments and suggestions regarding the quality of research and data analysis.

We only discussed potential mechanisms of influence and did not include a discussion of causality in this research program. Additionally, we provided an explanation of the limitations of our study in the discussion section.

Thank you for your valuable feedback once again.

2. The study participants were students affiliated with a single university, making the study less representative.

Response:Thank you very much for your question about the representativeness of the sample. Although the participants in this study all come from the same university, they represent different majors and come from various provinces, cities and counties across China. Nonetheless, we recognize that the sample still has certain limitations and cannot fully represent the entire Chinese college student population.. For future studies, we will consider expanding the sample size and covering more schools and districts to improve the representativeness of the study. Thank you for your reminder and feedback.

3.The analysis only identified simple correlations and did not adjust for several potential confounders.

Response:Thank you very much for your question. This study only addresses the mechanisms of the moderating effects of physical exercise behavior and does not include explanations regarding confounding factors. Thank you for your question.

Participants

1. The authors should provide an overview of Nantong University so that readers can assess representativeness.

Response:Thank you very much for your feedback. We have included line numbers 103-106 in the article to provide additional information on the location and background of Nantong University, as well as when it was founded and its position in the education system in order to provide readers with a better understanding of the basics of Nantong University. Thank you for your suggestion.

2. The authors should describe the study participants in detail, including in the text and a table.

Response:Thank you very much for your question. We have added Table 1, which presents the sample distribution, and detailed textual explanations in lines 110-113 of the article. so that readers can have a more detailed understanding of the basic information of the study participants. We appreciate your suggestion and have made the necessary modifications.

3. The authors should provide an in-depth discussion of one of the major limitations of this study, representativeness, in the discussion section.

Response:Thank you very much for your question. We will discuss the representativeness of the sample in the discussion section. This can be found at lines 428-431 of the article.

4. I did not understand the description of the sample size calculation method.

Response:Thank you very much for your question about the sample size calculation method. The calculation method used in this article is based on the approach mentioned in the literature by Chinese scholar Shao Zhiqiang. In this method, α corresponds to the formula zα, and α is generally set to 0.05. For a two-tailed test, z0.05 is 1.96, and for a one-tailed test, z0.05 is 1.64. δ represents the allowable error, which is usually determined based on experience and should not be too large. p represents the prevalence, which is the overall population prevalence and is typically set at 0.05. The finite population size N depends on the target population, such as the total number of students in a school or patients in a hospital.

Measurement Methods

5. The authors should provide a table of data on study participant characteristics, such as obesity rate, smoking and alcohol consumption rates, and potential confounders that may influence the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep, such as academic achievement, financial ability, commuting time to university, and living environment, if they measured these factors.

Response:Thank you very much for your question. As the questionnaire did not collect data on factors such as obesity rate, smoking and drinking rates, academic achievement and financial ability , this will be noted in the limitations of this study.

6. If the authors did not have access to the characteristics and potential confounders of the study participants, this should be noted in the discussion section as a limitation of the study.

Response:Thank you very much for your question. Since this article did not collect detailed data on features and confounding factors during data collection, we will point this out in the limitations of the discussion section,lines413-417.

7. The authors should cite the original article on the physical activity assessment study.

Response:Thank you very much for your question. We will add the original reference from Japanese scholar Hashimoto Kimio to the section on the sports activity level scale in section 2.2.3.

Statistical Analysis

8. The authors should adjust for confounders using multivariable analysis methods.

Response: Thank you very much for your question. This study only focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of physical exercise and does not involve explanations regarding confounding factors. Thank you for your question.

Reviewer #3: In this study, the authors investigate the influence of smartphone addiction on the sleep quality of college students: the regulatory effect of physical exercise behavior. The study draws attention with its sample size. My concerns about the study are listed below.

1.As the authors know, there are many studies conducted in this area (33. Sahin S, Ozdemir K, Unsal A, Temiz N. Evaluation of mobile phone addiction level and sleep quality in university students. Pak J Med Sci. 2013;29(4):913-8. doi: 10.12669/pjms.294.3686. PubMed PMID: WOS:000322619000005.)

More up-to-date resources in WOS could have been used (Buke, M., Egesoy, H., & Unver, F. (2021). The effect of smartphone addiction on physical activity level in sports science undergraduates. Journal of bodywork and movement therapies, 28, 530-534).

Response: Thank you very much for your guidance. We have replaced reference 33 in this study.

2.The concept of hypothesis is misused. H1-H2-H3 were questions that the authors sought answers to.

Response: Thank you very much for your question. This study will exclude the hypothesis section and only focus on seeking answers to the questions proposed by H1-H2-H3.

3.Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS) and Physical Activity 151 Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3) should be included in the summary.

Response: Thank you very much for your question. We will add the Mobile Addiction Tendency Scale and the Physical Activity Level Scale in the abstract, specifically at line number 31-33.

4.Spelling and punctuation in the text should be checked. Use the dot after the closed parenthesis.

Response: Thank you very much for your question. We have carefully checked the spelling and punctuation in the manuscript again. We have also sought assistance of a professional proofreading agency to ensure the coherence and correctness of the language in the article.

The authors have completed the necessary corrections.

Kind regards

Reviewer #4: Abstract:

"explore its regulating effect by introducing physical exercise" This refer as if the study an interventional one. Please rephrase in a way that make it a cross sectional study.

"r=-0.101", here do you mean r-squared of the regression? if not, please report r-squared instead of r value.

Introduction:

-"problems to people.[1]" please adjust the reference style.

- "generates negative emotions, such as fatigue and procrastination." where is the reference?

- "The current study on smartphone addiction mainly focus on mental health and

hygiene", Do you mean your study? Do you mean mental hygiene? Clarify please.

- Please include studies that previously assessed the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality (such as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9879389/), and those also assessed physical activity and its effect on sleep quality? Is there any study in China? Please highlight in the introduction to clarify the gap in knowledge.

- "What are the characteristics of contemporary college students' smartphone addiction, sleep quality, and physical exercise?" This is not the correct way to write a scientific hypothesis. In fact, the all the of them need to be rewritten or to change it into study objective.

-remove the word contemporary and rephrase the sentence.

Methods:

- "The scales used in the" do you mean questionnaire? replace.

- "effective rate of 78%." change it into response rate.

- "Given that the total population is 48,209 people" the total population of all university students in China, or in that university or what? if you have the reference that will be great.

Research Findings

- please include a table about demographic data of the participants.

- Also, I think you have to put a descriptive statistics to all the variables, in continuous and categorical format before going into analysis. This will answer the research hypothesis number 1 in your research.

- Table 1 design is little confusing, I wish you can adjust it so it can be read easily. For example, you have in the row three sections total, gender and academic year, so please make that clear.

- Table 2 is so confusing with the numbers, please either change the layout, or use 1 or 2 decimals maximum in the table. Remove F-value, as it is confusing.

- In Table 4 please put footnote for what model 1 include, and what model 2 include.

- In Table 4 please clarify if you used the data in its continuous format or categorical one, because that was not clear to reader.

Discussion:

- "previous studies[16]." in what country?

-"Trevor Egli MS" do you mean that this is reference 16 please put the reference here.

- In discussion from line 248-258, they were written without reference, if this is the author opinion, I think you should write, it is suggested or similar terms. This is applied to many parts in the discussion, where many sentences without reference. So I suggest that write what make it clear that this is your suggestion

- Your discussion is long, and I think you need to make subheading for it.

Dear Editors and Reviewers:

Thank you for your letter and the reviewer’s comments regarding our manuscript, “Influence of Smartphone Addiction on Sleep Quality of College Students: The Regulatory Effect of Physical Exercise Behavior”(PONE-D-23-21239).These comments have been invaluable and helpful in revising and improving our paper, as well as important guidance for our research. We have carefully studied these comments and made revisions, which we hope will be recognized. The revised parts are highlighted in red in the paper. The corrections in the paper and the responses to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:

Reviewer #4: Abstract:

"explore its regulating effect by introducing physical exercise" This refer as if the study an interventional one. Please rephrase in a way that make it a cross sectional study.

Response: Thank you for your insightful comments and for emphasizing the need for clarity regarding our study design. As you have correctly pointed out, the original wording suggested an interventional approach, which was not in line with the intent of our study.

I have revised the language in the manuscript to more accurately convey that our research is a cross-sectional analysis. We have rephrased the purpose of our study to underscore the examination of associations rather than implying any intervention. Moreover, I have highlighted the correlation between physical exercise and the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality to further clarify that our study design is observational in nature.

I hope these modifications address your concerns and faithfully communicate the cross-sectional nature of our study. Please feel free to make any further suggestions if necessary. For these changes, please refer to lines 26-30.

"r=-0.101", here do you mean r-squared of the regression? if not, please report r-squared instead of r value.

Response: Thank you for your inquiry. The "r=-0.101" mentioned here refers to the correlation coefficient result, not the r-squared value of the regression. You can find the report on r-squared in lines 37 to 39 of the revised manuscript. Should you have any further questions or require additional information, please feel free to let me know.

Introduction:

-"problems to people.[1]" please adjust the reference style.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I have corrected the reference style as per your suggestion. The updated reference can now be found in the revised manuscript at line number 49.

- "generates negative emotions, such as fatigue and procrastination." where is the reference?

Response:Thank you for your question and for pointing out the oversight. We have added the appropriate reference for this statement. Please refer to line 67 of the revised manuscript for the specific correction and the added citation. If there are any other concerns or clarifications needed, do not hesitate to contact us.

- "The current study on smartphone addiction mainly focus on mental health and

hygiene", Do you mean your study? Do you mean mental hygiene? Clarify please.

Response:Thank you for seeking clarification. When I referred to "The current study on smartphone addiction mainly focus on mental health and hygiene," I was intending to summarize the general trend of research in the area of smartphone addiction. Upon further examination, we recognized that there is insufficient evidence in the literature to substantiate the focus on mental health and hygiene specifically in relation to smartphone addiction. Consequently, we have opted to eliminate this statement from our manuscript to ensure accuracy. This change can be found in the revised version, where lines 67-69 have been removed.

- Please include studies that previously assessed the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality (such as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9879389/), and those also assessed physical activity and its effect on sleep quality? Is there any study in China? Please highlight in the introduction to clarify the gap in knowledge.

Response: Thank you for your insightful comments and your suggestion to include prior studies that assessed the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality, as well as the intersection of physical activity and its effect on sleep quality.

In response to your request, I will enrich the introduction section by discussing several pivotal studies that have investigated these important themes. For example, I will reference the study you provided (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9879389/), which offers a comprehensive analysis of how excessive smartphone use may detrimentally affect sleep quality.

Furthermore, I will make an effort to highlight research conducted in China regarding this topic. Indeed, scholars in China have undertaken numerous studies examining the effects of smartphone addiction on various aspects of health and daily life, including sleep quality. I will identify and include relevant Chinese studies to underline the existing research in the area, which will help to illustrate the current gap in knowledge that our study aims to address.

By integrating these studies, the introduction will clearly state the contribution of our research within the broader context of existing literature. This will not only fortify the backdrop against which our study stands but will also elucidate the necessity for further research to bridge the knowledge gap identified.For the relevant revisions, please refer to lines 86-92.

- "What are the characteristics of contemporary college students' smartphone addiction, sleep quality, and physical exercise?" This is not the correct way to write a scientific hypothesis. In fact, the all the of them need to be rewritten or to change it into study objective.

Response: Thank you for your keen observation regarding the construction of our research questions and hypotheses. Upon reflection, we concede that the initial formulation of our hypotheses more closely resembled questions, which could lead to misinterpretation and are not in line with the traditional scientific format.

In light of your comment, we have revised our study objectives to clearly delineate our aims and dispel any confusion. The hypotheses have been reformulated into objective statements that clearly chart the course of our investigation and lay the groundwork for operationalization and empirical testing. We believe these adjustments will elucidate the intent and scope of our research, ensuring that our objectives are more precise and methodologically robust.

We are grateful for the opportunity to integrate your invaluable feedback, which has undoubtedly enriched the framework of our research. We trust that these revisions will meet with your approval and will elevate the quality of our study. The pertinent revisions can be referenced on lines 107-112.

-remove the word contemporary and rephrase the sentence.

Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have removed the word "contemporary" and rephrased the sentence to better reflect our intended meaning. The revised sentence maintains the essence of the original statement while ensuring clarity and conciseness. We appreciate your attention to detail and agree that this modification improves the manuscript. Please see the revised sentence on line 109 of the updated document.

Methods:

- "The scales used in the" do you mean questionnaire? replace.

Response: Thank you for your comment. Indeed, when we referred to "the used scales," we were specifically alluding to the scales within the questionnaire. We have made the necessary correction in the text to express this unambiguously. The term "scales" previously mentioned in the text has now been replaced with "questionnaire." Please refer to line 122 in the revised manuscript for this correction. We appreciate your meticulous review and valuable feedback.

- "effective rate of 78%." change it into response rate.

Response: Thank you for your attentive reading of our manuscript and the suggestion to clarify our terminology. We agree that the term “effective rate of 78%” could be misunderstood and that “response rate” is more appropriate and commonly utilized in this context.

We have updated the manuscript to reflect this change. The phrase “effective rate of 78%” has now been revised to “response rate of 78%” to ensure clarity and align with standard research terminology.

Please refer to the updated line 131 in the revised manuscript where this correction has been applied.

We appreciate your valuable input and believe that this modification improves the accuracy and readability of our study.

- "Given that the total population is 48,209 people" the total population of all university students in China, or in that university or what? if you have the reference that will be great.

Response: Thank you very much for your question. The total population of 48,209 people mentioned here refers to the total number of enrolled students at Yangzhou University as of 2023, not the total number of university students in China. You can find the relevant information on the total number of students on the official website of Yangzhou University, which is http://www.yzu.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.htm. We apologize for not making this clear in our previous description in the article, and we have made the necessary revisions in the revised manuscript. Please refer to the updated line number 135.

Research Findings

- please include a table about demographic data of the participants.

Response: Thank you for your inquiry. I can confirm that the demographic data of the participants is indeed included in the article. We have organized this information into three sections: gender, academic level, and age. Please refer to line 128 for the relevant revisions.

- Also, I think you have to put a descriptive statistics to all the variables, in continuous and categorical format before going into analysis. This will answer the research hypothesis number 1 in your research.

Response: Thank you very much for your query. We have indeed classified the variables in the scale into their respective categories. For more detailed information, please refer to the revised manuscript at lines 157-158, 173-174, and 186. We believe this classification aligns with the requirements to adequately address research hypothesis number 1.

- Table 1 design is little confusing, I wish you can adjust it so it can be read easily. For example, you have in the row three sections total, gender and academic year, so please make that clear.

Response: Thank you for your meticulous review and valuable suggestions. We have made a series of improvements to Table 1 as per your guidance. Firstly, we have enhanced the distinction among the various categorization fields, ensuring that the “Total,” “Gender,” and “Grade Level” sections are clear and well-differentiated. Additionally, to further improve the table’s conciseness and readability, we have removed the “Age Group” information.

Please review the revised manuscript at your convenience. We highly value your feedback and hope that our modifications meet your approval.

We are sincerely grateful for your contribution to our work and look forward to your response.

- Table 2 is so confusing with the numbers, please either change the layout, or use 1 or 2 decimals maximum in the table. Remove F-value, as it is confusing.

Response: Thank you very much for your feedback. In reviewing Table 2, we noticed that it did not list the F-values; hence, we presume you might be referring to the issue with the F-values in Table 3. Following your suggestion, we have removed the F-values from Table 3 and adjusted the numeric values to two decimal places for increased clarity and conciseness.

We hope these changes address your concerns and enhance the readability of the data presentation. For details on the revisions, please refer to line number 225.

Thank you again for your valuable comments.

- In Table 4 please put footnote for what model 1 include, and what model 2 include.

Response: Thank you for inquiring about the contents of Table 4. As per your request, we will ensure the provision of appropriate footnotes detailing the components of Model 1 and Model 2 to enhance the clarity of our analysis for the reader's comprehension. We will make certain that these details are succinctly summarized in the footnotes to aid readers in better understanding the composition and outcomes of the models in our study. For specific modifications, please refer to lines 253-255.

- In Table 4 please clarify if you used the data in its continuous format or categorical one, because that was not clear to reader.

Response: Thank you very much for your inquiry regarding the nature of the data used in Table 4. To clarify, the data presented in Table 4 have been processed as categorical variables. We are extremely grateful for your attention to detail and understand the importance of clarifying this to our readers. To eliminate any ambiguity, we will revise the manuscript to explicitly state that the variables in Table 4 have been analyzed as categorical variables. We will make the necessary changes at lines 234-235 of the manuscript.

Discussion:

- "previous studies[16]." in what country?

Response: Thank you for your question regarding “previous studies[16].” I realize the importance of providing the geographic context of referenced studies for the reader’s understanding.

In response to your query, the previous studies mentioned are based in the United States. To clarify this in our manuscript, we have now included the country where the referenced research was conducted. You can find this update in lines 273-274 of the manuscript.

I appreciate your keen eye for detail and the opportunity to make our manuscript as informative and precise as possible.

-"Trevor Egli MS" do you mean that this is reference 16 please put the reference here.

Response: Thank you for your question, and I apologize for the oversight. I have now corrected the placement of the reference. Please see line 278 in the manuscript for the specific citation.

- In discussion from line 248-258, they were written without reference, if this is the author opinion, I think you should write, it is suggested or similar terms. This is applied to many parts in the discussion, where many sentences without reference. So I suggest that write what make it clear that this is your suggestion

Response: Thank you for your feedback. I understand your concerns regarding the lack of references for certain opinions expressed between lines 248-258 of the discussion section. I will take your suggestion and make it clear that these are our suggestions or personal viewpoints. I will address this issue throughout the relevant parts of the discussion to avoid confusion for the readers. For sentences without references, I will add phrases such as "we suggest" or "based on our observation" to clearly indicate that it reflects the authors' perspectives. Once again, I appreciate your valuable comments. For specific modifications, please refer to the manuscript lines 278-279 and 296-297.

- Your discussion is long, and I think you need to make subheading for it.

Response:Thank you for your constructive feedback on the discussion section of our manuscript. I appreciate your suggestion to incorporate subheadings to improve the readability and structure of our text.

I agree that the discussion section is rich in content, and adding subheadings will help readers better navigate and understand the various arguments and conclusions we have presented. We will revise this part by adding relevant subheadings that reflect the core points and themes of our discussion. Such restructuring will undoubtedly make the content more understandable and focused.

We will ensure that each subheading is short and descriptive, allowing readers to quickly grasp the main idea of the subsequent paragraphs. We believe these changes will enhance the overall clarity of the manuscript, and we thank you for pointing this out.

For specific modifications, please refer to lines 272-273, 319-320, 360-361, 398, and 411 of the manuscript.

This study aims to examine the association between smartphone addiction and sleep quality among college students, and assess the correlation with physical exercise in a non-interventional, cross-sectional study design. The study utilized data from the 2022 Chinese College Health Tracking Survey. A total of 4670 students participated in and completed the questionnaire. The test tools comprised the smartphone addiction tendency scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the physical activity rating scale. The average score of the college students’ smartphone addiction was 39.230±14.931, and the proportion of college students with average and or very poor sleep quality was 52.6%. Mobile phone addiction among college students is negatively correlated with physical exercise (r = -0.101, p<0.01), and positively correlated with sleep quality (r = 0.287, p<0.01. Physical exercise had a significant regulatory effect on the behavior relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality (ΔR2 = 0.194, p<0.001). Smartphone addiction has a significant impact on college students’ sleep quality. The higher the tendency towards smartphone addiction, the poorer the sleep quality of college students. Physical exercise plays a regulatory role in the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality of college students.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nMobile phone addiction refers to a new type of behavioral addiction in which individuals overuse smartphones to an uncontrollable extent, causing psychological, behavioral, and other problems to people [1]. According to the 51st Statistical Report on Internet Development in China, the number of Chinese netizens has reached 1.067 billion as of December 2022, of which young people aged 20–29 accounted for 14.2% [2]. With the improvement of living standards, electronic products such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops are increasingly used in the daily lives of Chinese college students. Students have spent more time in contact with smartphones due to online classes under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic [3, 4]. At the same time, the development of technology also made electronic products such as smartphones more portable and convenient to access the internet, and the vast social world behind it often attracts college students to immerse themselves in the electronic virtual world [5].\n\nIn discussing the relationship between smartphone addiction and the sleep quality of college students, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of their stage in emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood is a key developmental phase that involves the transition from adolescence to adulthood, during which individuals experience extended engagement in higher education, increased tolerance for premarital sex and cohabitation, and later ages of entering marriage and parenthood [6]. These changes grant them a self-focused freedom from role obligations and constraints, and satisfaction in progressing towards self-sufficiency [7]. However, the high degree of freedom and low societal role obligations at this stage may result in insufficient self-regulation in smartphone use. Excessive reliance on smartphones can not only impact their quality of life but may also lead to the development of mental health issues such as depressive symptoms and anxiety [8]. Therefore, devising effective intervention measures to reduce the negative impact of smartphone addiction is crucial for safeguarding the mental and physical health development of college students.\n\nCollege students have more leisure time compared to adolescents and adults due to their special growth stage, making them a high-risk group for smartphone addiction. A study in Saudi Arabia found that the longer the use of smartphones, the deeper the dependence on it [9]. The media dependency theory also indicates that the longer the use of the media, the greater the impact it has on its users [10].\n\nThe correct use of smartphones can provide great convenience to college students’ study and life, but excessive addiction to smartphone use not only reduces sleep quality but also generates negative emotions, such as fatigue and procrastination [11, 12]. Some studies have shown that the harm caused by smartphone addiction mainly includes physical problems such as headaches, blurred vision, and neck pain [13]. On the one hand, smartphone addiction can reduce the time college students spend on physical exercise, thereby decreasing their physical fitness. On the other hand, excessive use of smartphones can lead to poor sleep quality among students. A study by Orzech found that more than 72.9% of college students use smartphones for more than one hour before going to bed [14]. Pham’s research also indicated that pre-sleep smartphone addiction has become an important factor affecting the sleep quality of college students [15]. Therefore, exploring the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality among college students is greatly significant for their physical and mental health development.\n\nSleep plays an important role in the development of physical and psychological functions as part of a healthy lifestyle. Positive sleep quality is one of the necessary conditions for the development of individuals’ physiological and psychological functions [16]. However, smartphone addiction is one of the most important factors that has a negative impact on sleep quality [17]. As the main force of future development of the world, college students’ healthy development is related to the future of the world to some extent. Physical exercise is only considered as a measure to improve sleep quality, but few studies have explored the intrinsic relationship among smartphone addiction, sleep quality, and physical exercise. Early studies have indicated a significant correlation between smartphone addiction and a decline in sleep quality. For instance, researchers from Saudi Arabia have found that excessive smartphone use is associated with poor sleep quality [18]. A study from China has also revealed the negative impact of smartphone addiction on academic performance [19]. Additionally, there are studies indicating that smartphone addiction has a negative impact on sleep quality among the elderly population [20]. However, there is a lack of comprehensive perspective in the literature regarding how the level of physical activity might modulate this relationship.\n\nIn addition to the direct impacts related to smartphone addiction, physical activity is another important health behavioral factor that has been proven to positively correlate with sleep quality. Nonetheless, the interaction between smartphone addiction, physical activity levels, and sleep quality has not been fully explored in previous research. The intent of our study is to bridge this knowledge gap, with a particular focus on the unique population context in China. As one of the world’s largest markets for smartphones, understanding the specific circumstances of this region is crucial for a deeper comprehension and addressing of global health concerns. This study takes college students as the research object, and taking smartphone addiction and sleep quality as entry points and introducing physical exercise as a moderating variable (as shown in Fig 1). This study aims to explore the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality under the regulation of physical exercise. The primary objectives of this study are as follows:(1)To describe the patterns and extent of smartphone addiction, sleep quality, and physical exercise among Chinese college students.(2)To investigate the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality in college students.(3)To examine the role of physical exercise as a potential moderating mediator in the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality in college students.\n\nFig 1. The conceptual model of this study.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n2. Research methodology\n2.1 Participants\n\nThis study adopted a cross-sectional research design, and eight questionnaire investigators were trained before the data collection, all of whom were undergraduate counselors from various colleges of Nantong University. Nantong University was established in 1912 and is located in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, China. In the 2023 China University Evaluation by the China Academy of Management Sciences, it was ranked 102nd. The study utilized data from the 2022 Chinese College Health Tracking Survey, and the survey was conducted in September 2022. The participants were full-time freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors of Nantong University. All students signed electronic informed consent forms before participating. All students signed an electronic informed consent form prior to participation. The participant demographics are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

The research plan was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nantong University (2022(70)). The minimum sample size was calculated using Formula (1) [21], where the Type I error α was set to 0.05, the allowable error δ was set to 0.01, and the sampling rate ρ was set to 0.05. Given that the total population of Yangzhou University is 48,209 people (updated data in 2023), the limited total population N was set at 75% of the student population, which is approximately 36,157 people. The calculated minimum sample size required for this study was 1,738 [22].\n\n\t(1)\n2.2 Measurement methods\n2.2.1 Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS)\n\nThis study used the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS) to measure mobile phone addiction among university students, which was compiled by Chinese scholars Xiong et al. [23]. MPATS comprises four dimensions: withdrawal symptoms, salience, social comfort, and mood changes, with a total of 16 items. Each item is scored using a five-point Likert scale: “completely not applicable,” “somewhat not applicable,” “neutral,” “somewhat applicable,” and “completely applicable,” for which the scores range from 1 to 5. The highest score is 80, and the lowest is 16. A higher score indicates a greater tendency for mobile phone addiction, while a lower score indicates a lower tendency. The factor loadings of the four dimensions range from 0.51 to 0.79, with an overall variance explained of 54.3%. The confirmatory factor analysis results show the applicability of the four-factor model. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the total scale was 0.83, and the coefficients of the four factors ranged from 0.55 to 0.80. The test-retest reliability of the total scale was 0.91, while that of the four factors ranged from 0.75 to 0.85 [23]. The scale belongs to categorical variables.\n\n2.2.2 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\n\nThe sleep quality of the university students was measured by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI was compiled by Dr. Buysse, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh, along with others in 1989. The PSQI is suitable for the evaluation of sleep quality and therapeutic efficacy observation of sleep disorder patients and mental disorder patients, investigation and study of sleep quality of general population, and the evaluation tool for the study of the correlation between sleep quality and psychosomatic health. The scale is more suitable for use by the Chinese population after Liu’s revisions. The scale comprises 23 items and is divided into seven components, each of which is scored on a scale of 0–3. The cumulative score of each component is the total PSQI score, which ranges from 0 to 21. The higher the total score, the worse the sleep quality becomes. The criteria for the total score are as follows: a score of 0–4 indicates good sleep quality, 5–7 indicates average sleep quality, and 8–21 indicates poor sleep quality [24]. The scale has good reliability and validity, with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.764 [24]. The scale belongs to categorical variables.\n\n2.2.3 Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3)\n\nThe Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3) was compiled by Japanese scholar Hiroo Hashimoto and revised by Chinese scholar Liang [25, 26]. The scale consists of three items, and each question in the scale is divided into five levels, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. The total score is highest at 100 and lowest at 0. with 0 indicating no physical activity and 100 indicating maximum physical activity. The score criteria are as follows: low exercise level (≤19 points), moderate exercise level (20–42 points), and high exercise level (≥43 points) [25]. The PARS-3 results are a measure of sports activities and can reflect the behavioral state of college students’ participation in sports at a specific time to some extent. Domestic research shows that the internal consistency reliability coefficient of the scale is 0.856, while the retest reliability coefficient is 0.820 [25]. The scale belongs to categorical variables.\n\n2.3 Statistical analysis\n\nData processing was conducted by using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 and WPS Excel software(11.1.0.14309), which consisted of the following four steps: (1) Use Excel software to preprocess the data obtained from the questionnaire, and retest or delete the missing or problematic data. (2) After preprocessing the data, conduct a general analysis of the collected student data. The analysis content comprises sleep quality and physical exercise status. The Chi-square test was used to analyze the differences in physical exercise and sleep quality among students of different genders and grades. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences between sleep quality and physical exercise in male and female university students of various grades based on the effect size, η2. (3) A correlation analysis was performed to examine the correlation between the tendency of mobile phone addiction among university students (including withdrawal symptoms, highlight behavior, social comfort, and mood changes) and physical exercise, as well as sleep quality. (4) A linear regression analysis was used to test the effect of mobile phone addiction on sleep quality among university students, with physical exercise included as a moderating variable. Before calculating the moderation effect, the variables (Z-score) were standardized.\n\n3. Research findings\n3.1 General trends\n\nTable 2 shows that the proportion of male students who engaged in moderate (21.4%) and high levels (25.3%) of physical exercise was much higher than that of female students who engaged in moderate (9.5%) and high levels (4.9%) of physical exercise. Moreover, there was a significant difference in physical exercise between male and female students (p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.365). From a grade perspective, a significant difference exists in physical exercise among university students in different grades (p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.080). The number of freshmen who had good sleep quality (52.4%) was significantly higher than that of students in other grades. No significant difference exists in sleep quality between male and female students (p = 0.240, Cramer’s V = 0.400), but a significant difference exists in sleep quality among university students in different grades (p <0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.770).\n\nTable 2.

In Model 2, the predictive ability improved by 19.4%, meaning that the contribution rate of regulating effect is 19.4% under the condition that mobile addiction independent variable and sports exercise regulation variable remain unchanged. In addition, the significant F change in both models is less than 0.001. The mobile addiction independent variable and sports exercise regulation variable have a significant impact on the sleep quality dependent variable. In the analysis of variance, the P value is less than 0.001, indicating that the regulatory effect of sports exercise regulation variable on the mobile addiction independent variable is significant. Therefore, sports exercise is a regulatory factor for mobile addiction and sleep quality.\n\nTable 5. Results of moderating effects.\nSummary table of model\tANOVA\nModel\tR2\tΔR2\tdf1\tdf2\tSig.

Discussion\n\nSleep quality is becoming increasingly important for people’s physical health in today’s fast-paced life. The research object of this paper is Chinese college students. Through the investigation and analysis of their data, we explore the internal relationship among smartphone addiction, sleep quality and physical exercise. The score of smartphone addiction among university students is 39.23±14.93. Approximately 51.9% of university students have average or poor sleep quality. Smartphone addiction among university students is negatively correlated with physical exercise and positively correlated with sleep quality. Physical exercise has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality. Smartphone addiction among university students has a significant impact on sleep quality. The higher the tendency of smartphone addiction, the poorer the sleep quality of university students. Physical exercise plays a moderating role in the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality among university students.\n\n4.1 Analysis of the variability in physical exercise among college students\n\nThe proportion of male university students with moderate and high exercise levels is much higher than that of female university students. This is consistent with the findings of a previous study from the United States. Trevor Egli MS determined that the main factors driving exercise motivation among American male college students are strength, competition, and challenge, while the main factors driving exercise motivation among American female college students are weight management and appearance [27]. We believe that the reason for this phenomenon in China may be that the exercise motivations of different genders of college students have changed. Chinese male university students engage in moderate and high exercise levels more often, to pursue strength, competition and challenge, and thus most of them choose high-intensity exercise. The feudal society in China for thousands of years has given women the stereotypical label of quiet, gentle and peaceful, which has not been completely removed. Today, the aesthetic pursuit of women in China is based on to be thin for beauty, wherein more female university students engage in low-intensity aerobic exercise to maintain their beauty of body shape, which may be the reason why there are differences in physical exercise among Chinese university students based on gender.\n\nThis study found that there were significant differences in physical exercise among university students in different grades. This is consistent with Wu’s research [28], which found that senior students face with graduation and future career or study planning, and can only spend less time on physical exercise. The proportion of students in the first year engaging in moderate and high levels of exercise was slightly higher than that of students in the second, third, and fourth years. However, the proportion of freshmen was significantly lower than that of sophomore, junior, and senior students in terms of low-intensity exercise. We believe that the reasons for this phenomenon may be related to the education system in Chinese universities. students in the first year have less academic pressure and apart from the daily class time, they have no worries about other things. They have sufficient time for physical exercise without worrying about the lack of physical and mental strength which will affect other affairs. However, in the second, third, and fourth years, students not only face academic pressure, but the pressure of future career planning, further education and other aspects, which make them begin to use their extracurricular time to make up for their deficiencies. Therefore, students turn to low-intensity exercise to minimize physical exertion. In fourth year, the proportion of students engaging in moderate and high levels of exercise is higher than that of the second and third years. The reason for this may be that some fourth-year students have found jobs or obtained qualifications for further education, leading to an increase in the proportion of students engaging in moderate and high levels of exercise. This pressure is particularly prominent during the pandemic [29]. Additionally, it is crucial to understand that university students in China are in a critical evolutionary phase of transitioning from adolescence to adulthood, a period characterized by significant psychological and lifestyle changes [30]. This transition phase influences not only their academic and professional choices but also impacts their psychological well-being and daily behaviors including exercise habits. Undergraduate education in Chinese universities lasts only for four years (except for medical majors), and three out of the four years of college students enrolled in 2019 have been affected by the pandemic. Their schools cannot guarantee normal teaching, which leads to a lack of solid mastery of professional knowledge and skills, greatly increasing the students’ pressure for the future. Therefore, most sophomore and junior students chose low-intensity exercise to ensure that they have sufficient time and energy to study.\n\n4.2 Analysis of the differences in sleep quality among college students\n\nThis study determined that 51.9% of Chinese university students had problems with sleep quality. This is consistent with Hu’s research result, which found that more than half of the sample had sleep problems [31]. According to previous studies, long-term use of mobile phones and less physical exercise may be associated with poor sleep quality among university students [32].WANG suggested that university students’ sleep quality is susceptible to different risk factors, and the main determinants need to be considered when designing interventions to improve their sleep quality [33]. The university students’ sleep quality can be affected by various factors, and with the development of technology, smartphone addiction has gradually become an important factor affecting university students’ sleep quality [34]. This study mainly explores the influence of smartphone addiction on university students’ sleep quality, and smartphone addiction is considered as the main risk factor to investigate. Elizabeth B. Dowdell reported that a quarter of college students have a habit of using smartphones before sleep, which is associated with memory decline. Moreover, the trend of using smartphones before sleep shows an increasing tendency among college students [35]. Bartel, K study also mentioned that restricting the use of mobile phones in young people would enable them to sleep longer and have higher sleep quality [36]. All aforementioned studies have proved that smartphone addiction has an impact on sleep quality.\n\nNo significant gender differences exist in sleep quality among university students. This is different from previous studies where gender differences were found to play an important role in sleep quality, with higher sleep problem rates among females [37]. However, Zhang’s research found that sleep quality among East Asian women was better than that of women in other regions of the world [38]. This phenomenon may be related to cross-regional cultural differences. In terms of grade level, the sleep quality of freshmen was significantly better than that of students in the other three grades, which is related to the education system in China. In high school, Chinese students face heavy academic pressure, and the prevalence of sleep problems among Chinese high school students was 42.3%, according to Cao’s research [39]. However, in university, the decrease in academic pressure in the first year leads to an increase in students’ sleep time and improvement in sleep quality. However, students begin to consider their own development and future plans starting from second year, and the increasing pressure forces them to sacrifice more time in academic and skill learning. Therefore, from the data, it can be observed that the proportion of university students with poor sleep quality decreased significantly from first to third year. The reason for the improvement in sleep quality of senior students is that some of them have already found jobs with graduation approaching, and they no longer have to worry about academic and graduation pressures. Therefore, the sleep quality of students in this phase begins to improve.\n\n4.3 Analysis of the variability in mobile phone addiction among college students\n\nNo significant difference exists in mobile phone addiction between students of different genders. This is different from previous studies which indicated that females are more susceptible to mobile phone addiction [40, 41]. However, no difference exists in this paper. The possible reason for this may be that the epidemic has led to a decrease in the entertainment methods of college students. Frequent online classes, school closures and dormitory lockdowns have forced college students to spend more time indoors [42]. During this period, mobile phones became the most convenient way for communication and entertainment for students, regardless of their gender, which led to the result that no difference exists in mobile phone addiction between male and female students in this study.\n\nA significantly positive correlation exists between the four dimensions of mobile phone addiction in college students (withdrawal symptoms, salience, social comfort, and mood changes) and their sleep quality scores. A higher score on the PSQI represents lower sleep quality, which means that the higher the degree of mobile phone addiction among college students, the worse their sleep quality would be, which is consistent with the findings of Fengd’s study [43]. From December 2019 to December 2022, under the impact of COVID-19, China implemented normalized prevention and control policies, which forced many universities to adopt online teaching measures once positive cases were found in the cities where they were located. If students were in close contact with positive cases on campus, they had to undergo a seven-day home quarantine. In quarantine, smartphones became their only means of communication and information acquisition with the outside world. Social interaction is a universal basic human motivation [44]. Saadeh and H’s research investigation found that 85% of people in quarantine increased their mobile phone usage during the isolation period, with 42% using their phones for more than 6 hours per day [45]. Long-term quarantine can provide strong psychological pressure. Therefore, in long-term medical isolation situations, corresponding measures must be taken to ensure the psychological health of the quarantined individuals, avoiding negative mental problems. Previous studies have shown that sleep quality is influenced by many factors, such as lifestyle, environmental factors, work conditions, social life, economic conditions, physical health status, stress, and so on [46]. Mobile phone addiction, as an environmental factor, has a negative impact on sleep quality [47–49], which is consistent with the results of the correlation analysis in this study. Poor sleep quality can lead to depression and stress [50], affecting the health of college students in a significant negative way [51, 52]. Therefore, Chinese universities should take measures to reduce the use of smartphones by students.\n\n4.4 Correlation discussion\n\nA significantly negative correlation exists between the total score of college students’ physical exercise level and their sleep quality, indicating that physical exercise may improve college students’ sleep quality [53, 54]. In Dolezal’s study, regardless of the type and intensity of physical activity, exercise can improve subjective sleep quality [54]. Physical exercise promotes the college students’ physical and mental health. Severe mobile phone addiction is a psychological illness, and physical exercise has a significant positive impact on psychological improvement [55]. Physical exercise can reduce the impact of psychological stress on emotional states, promote emotional health [56], and provide a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Through physical exercise, college students can increase knowledge, develop skills, and feel a sense of fulfillment [57], which can enable them to focus their attention on real-life rather than seeking fulfillment in the virtual world.\n\n4.5 Moderating effect discussion\n\nThrough the analysis of the moderating effect, physical exercise has a significant moderating effect on the impact of mobile phone addiction on college students’ sleep quality. From a physiological perspective, the long-term use of smartphones by college students increases the amount of microwave radiation that the body receives. The central nervous system is the most sensitive target for microwave radiation. Therefore, microwave radiation’s impact on the human body is primarily through the nervous system [58]. The main cause of neurasthenia syndrome caused by electromagnetic radiation from smartphones is long-term close contact with the body [59]. This may be the reason why sleep quality is affected by mobile phone addiction. However, an explosion of information exists in today’s society, and smartphones are the most economical, convenient, and fastest way for college students to obtain external information. Continuous theory holds that the brain’s mental activity is continuous, and dreams at night unconsciously reflect daytime activity [60]. It is also important to consider that university students are in a crucial developmental phase transitioning from adolescence to adulthood, characterized by significant psychological and lifestyle changes. This transition not only influences their academic and career choices but also their sleep patterns and behaviors, including smartphone use [61]. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the most common information college students obtained through short videos was related to the epidemic, increasing their anxiety. Therefore, prolonged use of smartphones can cause college students to unconsciously recall the information they searched for about the epidemic during the day [62], which is also one of the reasons for poor sleep quality in college students. Understanding the developmental stage of university students can provide additional context to analyze how factors like smartphone addiction impact their sleep quality.\n\nThe significant moderating effect of physical exercise on sleep quality in college students may be due to the following reasons: (1) When college students engage in physical exercise, they reduce the time of using smartphones, which reduces the impact of microwave radiation on their central nervous system [58]. (2) Through physical exercise, college students gain a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction, reducing their need to seek fulfillment in the virtual world of smartphones [63]. (3) Physical exercise can release the stress that college students experience in their studies and daily life, thus improving their sleep quality [64].\n\nThe limitations of this study comprise the following: (1) Mobile phone addiction is caused by multiple factors, and there are many interfering factors in the exploration process. The impact of each variable must be explored through quasi-experimental and longitudinal studies, which can be future research directions. (2) The scope of the investigation needs to be further expanded, and the research subjects should be representative to verify the universality and rationality of this study. (3) This study only discusses the impact mechanism of physical exercise on mobile phone addiction and sleep quality, without delving into the discussion of causal relationships. (4) The study did not collect information on participant characteristics and potential confounding factors during data collection, which is a limitation of this study.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe proportion of university students with sleep quality problems is 51.9%, which may be related to the degree of mobile phone addiction. The proportion of male university students who engage in moderate and high levels of exercise is much higher than that of female university students, and this phenomenon may be due to differences in exercise motivation. Mobile phone addiction among university students is negatively correlated with physical exercise and positively correlated with sleep quality. The more severe the mobile phone addiction among university students, the worse their sleep quality would be. Physical exercise can significantly regulate the adverse effects of mobile phone addiction on sleep quality among university students. Although the sample size of this study is concentrated in a single school, the students admitted to this school come from different provinces and regions. Therefore, there are variations in lifestyle habits and practices, which to some extent reduces the limitations of the study. The data can provide theoretical support for improving the sleep quality of university students.\n\nSupporting information\nS1 Data\n\n(SAV)\n\npone.0307162.s001.sav (170KB, sav)\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the participants and their universities for the cooperation and participation in this study.\n\nData Availability\n\nAll relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting information files.\n\nFunding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by: Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX24_3498), received by Weidong Zhu The General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province. “Research on the promotion of physical and mental health of college students based on the improvement of physical literacy” (No: 2024SJYB1253), received by Bo Li National Social Science Fund “14th Five-Year Plan” General Project in the field of Education for the year 2021 (BLA210215), received by Hu Lou Key Project of Jiangsu Provincial Education Science Planning (B/2022/01/173), received by Bo Li.\n\nReferences\n1.Liu QQ, Xu XP, Yang XJ, Xiong J, Hu YT.

The language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous.\n\n2.Your paper layout needs further beautification. For example, formula (1) is too large for the paper.\n\nReviewer #2:\xa0Thank you for giving me the opportunity for this review.\n\nThis study examined the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality in a single university in China, taking into account exercise behavior. Smartphone addiction is an emerging social issue and this study deals with an important public health topic.\n\nWhile the results presented are common sense and valid, the quality of this study is low and the data does not seem to corroborate the results presented with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nThere are several major issues with this study. First, this is a cross-sectional study, and the study design does not allow for reference to causal relationships. Second, the study participants were students affiliated with a single university, making the study less representative. Third, the analysis only identified simple correlations and did not adjust for several potential confounders.\n\nParticipants\n\n1. The authors should provide an overview of Nantong University so that readers can assess representativeness.\n\n2.

We have carefully studied these comments and made revisions, which we hope will be recognized. The revised parts are highlighted in red in the paper. The corrections in the paper and the responses to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:\n\nReviewer #1:\xa0\n\n1.Your English writing needs further improvement. The language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous.\n\nResponse:We recognize your concern for the clarity and correctness of our English writing. We apologize for any ambiguities or errors that may have occurred. As a result, we have sought the assistance of a professional academic editing agency to ensure the accuracy and fluency of the language in this revision. We will be working closely with them to meticulously proofread and revise the paper.Thank you for your suggestion, and we will strive to ensure the language quality of the paper, as evidenced by the proof of editing provided below.\n\n2.Your paper layout needs further beautification. For example, formula (1) is too large for the paper.\n\nResponse:We appreciate your feedback on the layout of our paper. We understand that the font size of Equation (1) is too large, making the article aesthetically unappealing. We will carefully adjust the font size and formatting to ensure that all formulas and charts are visually appealing while maintaining readability. Thank you for your suggestion, and we will strive to make improvements accordingly.\n\nReviewer #2：\n\n1.This is a cross-sectional study, and the study design does not allow for reference to causal relationships.\n\nResponse:Thank you for your review and valuable feedback on our research titled "Influence of Smartphone Addiction on Sleep Quality of College Students: The Regulatory Effect of Physical Exercise Behavior" We greatly appreciate your comments and suggestions regarding the quality of research and data analysis.\n\nWe only discussed potential mechanisms of influence and did not include a discussion of causality in this research program. Additionally, we provided an explanation of the limitations of our study in the discussion section.\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback once again.\n\n2.\xa0The study participants were students affiliated with a single university, making the study less representative.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question about the representativeness of the sample. Although the participants in this study all come from the same university, they represent different majors and come from various provinces, cities and counties across China. Nonetheless, we recognize that the sample still has certain limitations and cannot fully represent the entire Chinese college student population.. For future studies, we will consider expanding the sample size and covering more schools and districts to improve the representativeness of the study. Thank you for your reminder and feedback.\n\n3.The analysis only identified simple correlations and did not adjust for several potential confounders.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question. This study only addresses the mechanisms of the moderating effects of physical exercise behavior and does not include explanations regarding confounding factors. Thank you for your question.\n\nParticipants\n\n1. The authors should provide an overview of Nantong University so that readers can assess representativeness.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your feedback. We have included line numbers 103-106 in the article to provide additional information on the location and background of Nantong University, as well as when it was founded and its position in the education system in order to provide readers with a better understanding of the basics of Nantong University. Thank you for your suggestion.\n\n2. The authors should describe the study participants in detail, including in the text and a table.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question. We have added Table 1, which presents the sample distribution, and detailed textual explanations in lines 110-113 of the article. so that readers can have a more detailed understanding of the basic information of the study participants. We appreciate your suggestion and have made the necessary modifications.\n\n3. The authors should provide an in-depth discussion of one of the major limitations of this study, representativeness, in the discussion section.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question. We will discuss the representativeness of the sample in the discussion section. This can be found at lines 428-431 of the article.\n\n4. I did not understand the description of the sample size calculation method.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question about the sample size calculation method. The calculation method used in this article is based on the approach mentioned in the literature by Chinese scholar Shao Zhiqiang. In this method, α corresponds to the formula zα, and α is generally set to 0.05. For a two-tailed test, z0.05 is 1.96, and for a one-tailed test, z0.05 is 1.64. δ represents the allowable error, which is usually determined based on experience and should not be too large. p represents the prevalence, which is the overall population prevalence and is typically set at 0.05. The finite population size N depends on the target population, such as the total number of students in a school or patients in a hospital.\n\nMeasurement Methods\n\n5. The authors should provide a table of data on study participant characteristics, such as obesity rate, smoking and alcohol consumption rates, and potential confounders that may influence the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep, such as academic achievement, financial ability, commuting time to university, and living environment, if they measured these factors.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question. As the questionnaire did not collect data on factors such as obesity rate, smoking and drinking rates, academic achievement and financial ability , this will be noted in the limitations of this study.\n\n6. If the authors did not have access to the characteristics and potential confounders of the study participants, this should be noted in the discussion section as a limitation of the study.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question. Since this article did not collect detailed data on features and confounding factors during data collection, we will point this out in the limitations of the discussion section,lines413-417.\n\n7. The authors should cite the original article on the physical activity assessment study.\n\nResponse:Thank you very much for your question. We will add the original reference from Japanese scholar Hashimoto Kimio to the section on the sports activity level scale in section 2.2.3.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\n8. The authors should adjust for confounders using multivariable analysis methods.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your question. This study only focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of physical exercise and does not involve explanations regarding confounding factors. Thank you for your question.\n\nReviewer #3:\xa0In this study, the authors investigate the influence of smartphone addiction on the sleep quality of college students: the regulatory effect of physical exercise behavior. The study draws attention with its sample size. My concerns about the study are listed below.\n\n1.As the authors know, there are many studies conducted in this area (33.

H1-H2-H3 were questions that the authors sought answers to.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your question. This study will exclude the hypothesis section and only focus on seeking answers to the questions proposed by H1-H2-H3.\n\n3.Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS) and Physical Activity 151 Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3) should be included in the summary.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your question. We will add the Mobile Addiction Tendency Scale and the Physical Activity Level Scale in the abstract, specifically at line number 31-33.\n\n4.Spelling and punctuation in the text should be checked. Use the dot after the closed parenthesis.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your question. We have carefully checked the spelling and punctuation in the manuscript again.

We have carefully studied these comments and made revisions, which we hope will be recognized. The revised parts are highlighted in red in the paper. The corrections in the paper and the responses to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:\n\nReviewer #4:\xa0Abstract:\n\n"explore its regulating effect by introducing physical exercise" This refer as if the study an interventional one. Please rephrase in a way that make it a cross sectional study.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your insightful comments and for emphasizing the need for clarity regarding our study design. As you have correctly pointed out, the original wording suggested an interventional approach, which was not in line with the intent of our study.\n\nI have revised the language in the manuscript to more accurately convey that our research is a cross-sectional analysis. We have rephrased the purpose of our study to underscore the examination of associations rather than implying any intervention. Moreover, I have highlighted the correlation between physical exercise and the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality to further clarify that our study design is observational in nature.\n\nI hope these modifications address your concerns and faithfully communicate the cross-sectional nature of our study. Please feel free to make any further suggestions if necessary. For these changes, please refer to lines 26-30.\n\n"r=-0.101", here do you mean r-squared of the regression? if not, please report r-squared instead of r value.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your inquiry. The "r=-0.101" mentioned here refers to the correlation coefficient result, not the r-squared value of the regression. You can find the report on r-squared in lines 37 to 39 of the revised manuscript. Should you have any further questions or require additional information, please feel free to let me know.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n-"problems to people.[1]" please adjust the reference style.\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention. I have corrected the reference style as per your suggestion. The updated reference can now be found in the revised manuscript at line number 49.\n\n- "generates negative emotions, such as fatigue and procrastination." where is the reference?\n\nResponse:Thank you for your question and for pointing out the oversight. We have added the appropriate reference for this statement. Please refer to line 67 of the revised manuscript for the specific correction and the added citation. If there are any other concerns or clarifications needed, do not hesitate to contact us.\n\n- "The current study on smartphone addiction mainly focus on mental health and\n\nhygiene", Do you mean your study? Do you mean mental hygiene? Clarify please.\n\nResponse:Thank you for seeking clarification. When I referred to "The current study on smartphone addiction mainly focus on mental health and hygiene," I was intending to summarize the general trend of research in the area of smartphone addiction. Upon further examination, we recognized that there is insufficient evidence in the literature to substantiate the focus on mental health and hygiene specifically in relation to smartphone addiction. Consequently, we have opted to eliminate this statement from our manuscript to ensure accuracy. This change can be found in the revised version, where lines 67-69 have been removed.\n\n- Please include studies that previously assessed the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality (such as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9879389/), and those also assessed physical activity and its effect on sleep quality? Is there any study in China? Please highlight in the introduction to clarify the gap in knowledge.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your insightful comments and your suggestion to include prior studies that assessed the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality, as well as the intersection of physical activity and its effect on sleep quality.\n\nIn response to your request, I will enrich the introduction section by discussing several pivotal studies that have investigated these important themes. For example, I will reference the study you provided (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9879389/), which offers a comprehensive analysis of how excessive smartphone use may detrimentally affect sleep quality.\n\nFurthermore, I will make an effort to highlight research conducted in China regarding this topic. Indeed, scholars in China have undertaken numerous studies examining the effects of smartphone addiction on various aspects of health and daily life, including sleep quality. I will identify and include relevant Chinese studies to underline the existing research in the area, which will help to illustrate the current gap in knowledge that our study aims to address.\n\nBy integrating these studies, the introduction will clearly state the contribution of our research within the broader context of existing literature. This will not only fortify the backdrop against which our study stands but will also elucidate the necessity for further research to bridge the knowledge gap identified.For the relevant revisions, please refer to lines 86-92.\n\n- "What are the characteristics of contemporary college students\' smartphone addiction, sleep quality, and physical exercise?" This is not the correct way to write a scientific hypothesis. In fact, the all the of them need to be rewritten or to change it into study objective.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your keen observation regarding the construction of our research questions and hypotheses. Upon reflection, we concede that the initial formulation of our hypotheses more closely resembled questions, which could lead to misinterpretation and are not in line with the traditional scientific format.\n\nIn light of your comment, we have revised our study objectives to clearly delineate our aims and dispel any confusion. The hypotheses have been reformulated into objective statements that clearly chart the course of our investigation and lay the groundwork for operationalization and empirical testing. We believe these adjustments will elucidate the intent and scope of our research, ensuring that our objectives are more precise and methodologically robust.\n\nWe are grateful for the opportunity to integrate your invaluable feedback, which has undoubtedly enriched the framework of our research. We trust that these revisions will meet with your approval and will elevate the quality of our study. The pertinent revisions can be referenced on lines 107-112.\n\n-remove the word contemporary and rephrase the sentence.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your suggestion. We have removed the word "contemporary" and rephrased the sentence to better reflect our intended meaning. The revised sentence maintains the essence of the original statement while ensuring clarity and conciseness. We appreciate your attention to detail and agree that this modification improves the manuscript. Please see the revised sentence on line 109 of the updated document.\n\nMethods:\n\n- "The scales used in the" do you mean questionnaire? replace.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your comment. Indeed, when we referred to "the used scales," we were specifically alluding to the scales within the questionnaire. We have made the necessary correction in the text to express this unambiguously. The term "scales" previously mentioned in the text has now been replaced with "questionnaire." Please refer to line 122 in the revised manuscript for this correction. We appreciate your meticulous review and valuable feedback.\n\n- "effective rate of 78%." change it into response rate.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your attentive reading of our manuscript and the suggestion to clarify our terminology. We agree that the term “effective rate of 78%” could be misunderstood and that “response rate” is more appropriate and commonly utilized in this context.\n\nWe have updated the manuscript to reflect this change. The phrase “effective rate of 78%” has now been revised to “response rate of 78%” to ensure clarity and align with standard research terminology.\n\nPlease refer to the updated line 131 in the revised manuscript where this correction has been applied.\n\nWe appreciate your valuable input and believe that this modification improves the accuracy and readability of our study.\n\n- "Given that the total population is 48,209 people" the total population of all university students in China, or in that university or what? if you have the reference that will be great.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your question. The total population of 48,209 people mentioned here refers to the total number of enrolled students at Yangzhou University as of 2023, not the total number of university students in China. You can find the relevant information on the total number of students on the official website of Yangzhou University, which is http://www.yzu.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.htm. We apologize for not making this clear in our previous description in the article, and we have made the necessary revisions in the revised manuscript. Please refer to the updated line number 135.\n\nResearch Findings\n\n- please include a table about demographic data of the participants.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your inquiry. I can confirm that the demographic data of the participants is indeed included in the article. We have organized this information into three sections: gender, academic level, and age. Please refer to line 128 for the relevant revisions.\n\n- Also, I think you have to put a descriptive statistics to all the variables, in continuous and categorical format before going into analysis. This will answer the research hypothesis number 1 in your research.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your query. We have indeed classified the variables in the scale into their respective categories. For more detailed information, please refer to the revised manuscript at lines 157-158, 173-174, and 186. We believe this classification aligns with the requirements to adequately address research hypothesis number 1.\n\n- Table 1 design is little confusing, I wish you can adjust it so it can be read easily. For example, you have in the row three sections total, gender and academic year, so please make that clear.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your meticulous review and valuable suggestions. We have made a series of improvements to Table 1 as per your guidance. Firstly, we have enhanced the distinction among the various categorization fields, ensuring that the “Total,” “Gender,” and “Grade Level” sections are clear and well-differentiated. Additionally, to further improve the table’s conciseness and readability, we have removed the “Age Group” information.\n\nPlease review the revised manuscript at your convenience. We highly value your feedback and hope that our modifications meet your approval.\n\nWe are sincerely grateful for your contribution to our work and look forward to your response.\n\n- Table 2 is so confusing with the numbers, please either change the layout, or use 1 or 2 decimals maximum in the table. Remove F-value, as it is confusing.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your feedback. In reviewing Table 2, we noticed that it did not list the F-values; hence, we presume you might be referring to the issue with the F-values in Table 3. Following your suggestion, we have removed the F-values from Table 3 and adjusted the numeric values to two decimal places for increased clarity and conciseness.\n\nWe hope these changes address your concerns and enhance the readability of the data presentation. For details on the revisions, please refer to line number 225.\n\nThank you again for your valuable comments.\n\n- In Table 4 please put footnote for what model 1 include, and what model 2 include.\n\nResponse: Thank you for inquiring about the contents of Table 4. As per your request, we will ensure the provision of appropriate footnotes detailing the components of Model 1 and Model 2 to enhance the clarity of our analysis for the reader\'s comprehension. We will make certain that these details are succinctly summarized in the footnotes to aid readers in better understanding the composition and outcomes of the models in our study. For specific modifications, please refer to lines 253-255.\n\n- In Table 4 please clarify if you used the data in its continuous format or categorical one, because that was not clear to reader.\n\nResponse: Thank you very much for your inquiry regarding the nature of the data used in Table 4. To clarify, the data presented in Table 4 have been processed as categorical variables. We are extremely grateful for your attention to detail and understand the importance of clarifying this to our readers. To eliminate any ambiguity, we will revise the manuscript to explicitly state that the variables in Table 4 have been analyzed as categorical variables. We will make the necessary changes at lines 234-235 of the manuscript.\n\nDiscussion:\n\n- "previous studies[16]." in what country?\n\nResponse: Thank you for your question regarding “previous studies[16].” I realize the importance of providing the geographic context of referenced studies for the reader’s understanding.\n\nIn response to your query, the previous studies mentioned are based in the United States. To clarify this in our manuscript, we have now included the country where the referenced research was conducted. You can find this update in lines 273-274 of the manuscript.\n\nI appreciate your keen eye for detail and the opportunity to make our manuscript as informative and precise as possible.\n\n-"Trevor Egli MS" do you mean that this is reference 16 please put the reference here.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your question, and I apologize for the oversight. I have now corrected the placement of the reference. Please see line 278 in the manuscript for the specific citation.\n\n- In discussion from line 248-258, they were written without reference, if this is the author opinion, I think you should write, it is suggested or similar terms. This is applied to many parts in the discussion, where many sentences without reference. So I suggest that write what make it clear that this is your suggestion\n\nResponse: Thank you for your feedback. I understand your concerns regarding the lack of references for certain opinions expressed between lines 248-258 of the discussion section. I will take your suggestion and make it clear that these are our suggestions or personal viewpoints. I will address this issue throughout the relevant parts of the discussion to avoid confusion for the readers. For sentences without references, I will add phrases such as "we suggest" or "based on our observation" to clearly indicate that it reflects the authors\' perspectives. Once again, I appreciate your valuable comments. For specific modifications, please refer to the manuscript lines 278-279 and 296-297.\n\n- Your discussion is long, and I think you need to make subheading for it.\n\nResponse:Thank you for your constructive feedback on the discussion section of our manuscript. I appreciate your suggestion to incorporate subheadings to improve the readability and structure of our text.\n\nI agree that the discussion section is rich in content, and adding subheadings will help readers better navigate and understand the various arguments and conclusions we have presented. We will revise this part by adding relevant subheadings that reflect the core points and themes of our discussion. Such restructuring will undoubtedly make the content more understandable and focused.\n\nWe will ensure that each subheading is short and descriptive, allowing readers to quickly grasp the main idea of the subsequent paragraphs. We believe these changes will enhance the overall clarity of the manuscript, and we thank you for pointing this out.\n\nFor specific modifications, please refer to lines 272-273, 319-320, 360-361, 398, and 411 of the manuscript.\n\nAttachment\n\nSubmitted filename: Response to Reviewer.docx\n\npone.0307162.s003.docx (22.1KB, docx)\nPLoS One. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0307162.r005\nDecision Letter 2\nSohel Ahmed\nAuthor information\nCopyright and License information\n\n9 May 2024\n\nPONE-D-23-21239R2Influence of Smartphone Addiction on Sleep Quality of College Students: The Regulatory Effect of Physical Exercise BehaviorPLOS ONE\n\nDear Dr. Li,\n\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE.

### Report on the Effects of Smartphone Usage on Sleep Quality Among Boarding School Students

#### Introduction
The study titled "The Impact of Smartphone Addiction on Sleep Quality Among High School Students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia" provides a comprehensive analysis of how smartphone addiction affects sleep quality among adolescents. Although the study focuses on high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, the findings can be extrapolated to understand similar effects among boarding school students, given the shared characteristics of adolescent behavior and smartphone usage.

#### Background
Smartphones have become ubiquitous, offering various functionalities beyond communication, such as gaming, social interaction, and online shopping. This widespread use has led to concerns about smartphone addiction, particularly among adolescents, and its potential impact on sleep quality and overall health.

#### Objectives
The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.

#### Methodology
- **Design**: Analytical cross-sectional study.
- **Participants**: 373 high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
- **Data Collection**: Online self-administered survey using the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
- **Analysis**: Data analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, with Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality.

#### Key Findings
1. **Demographics**: The study included 66% male and 34% female participants, with a median age of 16 years.
2. **Smartphone Usage**: The median number of hours spent on smartphones was six per day. The mean SAS-SV score was 38.5 out of 60, indicating a high level of smartphone addiction.
3. **Sleep Quality**: The average global PSQI score was 6.63 out of 21, suggesting poor sleep quality among participants.
4. **Correlation**: A positive correlation (r = 0.261; p < 0.001) was found between smartphone addiction and poor sleep quality, indicating that higher smartphone addiction is associated with worse sleep quality.
5. **Factors Influencing Sleep Quality**: Factors such as higher smartphone usage, caffeine intake less than six hours before bedtime, and psychiatric conditions were significantly associated with poor sleep quality.

#### Discussion
The study highlights the significant impact of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among adolescents. The findings align with other studies indicating that excessive smartphone use is linked to poor sleep quality, increased daytime dysfunction, and potential long-term health implications. The study also notes the role of environmental factors, such as electromagnetic fields, in affecting sleep patterns.

#### Conclusion
The study concludes that high smartphone addiction is significantly correlated with poor sleep quality among high school students. This correlation underscores the need for interventions to mitigate smartphone addiction and improve sleep quality among adolescents.

#### Recommendations
- **Education**: Raise awareness among students about the risks of smartphone addiction and the importance of healthy sleep habits.
- **Policy**: Implement guidelines in schools to manage smartphone usage, especially during nighttime.
- **Further Research**: Conduct longitudinal studies to explore the causal relationships between smartphone addiction and sleep quality.

#### Implications for Boarding School Students
While the study focuses on high school students in Makkah, the implications are relevant for boarding school students who may experience similar patterns of smartphone usage and sleep disturbances. Boarding schools can benefit from implementing structured programs to educate students about responsible smartphone use and its impact on sleep and overall well-being.

### Requirements
Please provide a detailed research report in response to the following topic: "What are the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among boarding school students, and how do these effects compare to students who have restricted phone access after bedtime?", using the information provided above. The report must meet the following requirements:

- Focus on directly addressing the chosen topic.
- Ensure a well-structured and in-depth presentation, incorporating relevant facts and figures where available.
- Present data and findings in an intuitive manner, utilizing feature comparative tables, if applicable.
- The report should have a minimum word count of 2,000 and be formatted with Markdown syntax following APA style guidelines.

Your sole purpose is to write well written, critically acclaimed, objective and structured reports on the given text.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '### Reference Information\n### Report on the Effects of Smartphone Usage on Sleep Quality Among Boarding School Students\n\n#### Introduction\nThe study titled "The Impact of Smartphone Addiction on Sleep Quality Among High School Students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia" provides a comprehensive analysis of how smartphone addiction affects sleep quality among adolescents. Although the study focuses on high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, the findings can be extrapolated to understand similar effects among boarding school students, given the shared characteristics of adolescent behavior and smartphone usage.\n\n#### Background\nSmartphones have become ubiquitous, offering various functionalities beyond communication, such as gaming, social interaction, and online shopping. This widespread use has led to concerns about smartphone addiction, particularly among adolescents, and its potential impact on sleep quality and overall health.\n\n#### Objectives\nThe primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\n#### Methodology\n- **Design**: Analytical cross-sectional study.\n- **Participants**: 373 high school students in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n- **Data Collection**: Online self-administered survey using the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n- **Analysis**: Data analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, with Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between smartphone addiction and sleep quality.\n\n#### Key Findings\n1. **Demographics**: The study included 66% male and 34% female participants, with a median age of 16 years.\n2. **Smartphone Usage**: The median number of hours spent on smartphones was six per day. The mean SAS-SV score was 38.5 out of 60, indicating a high level of smartphone addiction.\n3. **Sleep Quality**: The average global PSQI score was 6.63 out of 21, suggesting poor sleep quality among participants.\n4. **Correlation**: A positive correlation (r = 0.261; p < 0.001) was found between smartphone addiction and poor sleep quality, indicating that higher smartphone addiction is associated with worse sleep quality.\n5. **Factors Influencing Sleep Quality**: Factors such as higher smartphone usage, caffeine intake less than six hours before bedtime, and psychiatric conditions were significantly associated with poor sleep quality.\n\n#### Discussion\nThe study highlights the significant impact of smartphone addiction on sleep quality among adolescents. The findings align with other studies indicating that excessive smartphone use is linked to poor sleep quality, increased daytime dysfunction, and potential long-term health implications. The study also notes the role of environmental factors, such as electromagnetic fields, in affecting sleep patterns.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe study concludes that high smartphone addiction is significantly correlated with poor sleep quality among high school students. This correlation underscores the need for interventions to mitigate smartphone addiction and improve sleep quality among adolescents.\n\n#### Recommendations\n- **Education**: Raise awareness among students about the risks of smartphone addiction and the importance of healthy sleep habits.\n- **Policy**: Implement guidelines in schools to manage smartphone usage, especially during nighttime.\n- **Further Research**: Conduct longitudinal studies to explore the causal relationships between smartphone addiction and sleep quality.\n\n#### Implications for Boarding School Students\nWhile the study focuses on high school students in Makkah, the implications are relevant for boarding school students who may experience similar patterns of smartphone usage and sleep disturbances. Boarding schools can benefit from implementing structured programs to educate students about responsible smartphone use and its impact on sleep and overall well-being.\n\n### Requirements\nPlease provide a detailed research report in response to the following topic: "What are the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among boarding school students, and how do these effects compare to students who have restricted phone access after bedtime?", using the information provided above. The report must meet the following requirements:\n\n- Focus on directly addressing the chosen topic.\n- Ensure a well-structured and in-depth presentation, incorporating relevant facts and figures where available.\n- Present data and findings in an intuitive manner, utilizing feature comparative tables, if applicable.\n- The report should have a minimum word count of 2,000 and be formatted with Markdown syntax following APA style guidelines.\n- Include all source URLs in APA format at the end of the report.\n'}]

Abstract

Smartphones are an integral part of our lives due to benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment including games. The many benefits of a smartphone, like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are however balanced by negative health consequences. Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Sleep plays a crucial role in memory and is essential for all stages of learning. Restorative sleep may also prepare the brain for new learning. The use of smartphones could disrupt lifestyle, sleep, and potentially, multiple cellular processes through their impact on circadian rhythms and lead to significant and widespread morbidity and mortality. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. These findings must be seen against the background of widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone use and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance. The implications of circadian disruption for learning populations, such as university students and professionals training for careers in medicine, and other critical occupations, cannot be overstated. This review highlights the possible negative consequences of smartphone use on overall sleep health while emphasizing the importance of studying its impact, on mental health and learning outcomes, in different populations. The review aimed to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and the consequences for their academic achievement. The method used was a comprehensive search strategy using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases with appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.

Introduction and background

Mobile phones are mass-produced electronic devices that are an integral part of our lives due to benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment, including games. They are popular, especially because they provide these benefits instantly, due to their portability and size [1].

Smartphones, on the other hand, are technologically more advanced mobile devices, which can perform many of the functions of a computer, in addition to those of mobile phones, while having the same convenience and form factor. Given the multifaceted applications of a smartphone, it has also progressively become an intrinsic part of our lives and relationships. 

The many benefits of a smartphone like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are, however, balanced by negative health consequences, including neck pain, accidents, poor mental health, and sleep disturbances [2]. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. A systematic review of Indian adolescents revealed that smartphone addiction among adolescents was 39% to 44% on average. Nearly 300 million of the Indian population uses smartphones [3]. Surveys suggest that up to 50% of teens and 27% of their parents feel that they may be addicted to mobile phones [4].

These negative health consequences are repeatedly highlighted by the popular press. However, it must be kept in mind that many of these negative health consequences of smartphone use are speculative and alarmist. Mental health professionals need to have actionable evidence to counsel their clients in a balanced and appropriate manner based on available scientific evidence [5-6]. 

The objective of this clinically oriented comprehensive review was to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and its consequences on their academic achievement. The methodology used was a comprehensive search strategy in Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases using appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.

Review

Methodology

To conduct this review, a comprehensive search was undertaken using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Keywords include “adolescents”, “psychiatry and mental health”, “learning”, “sleep pattern”, and "smartphone usage”. The search results were supplemented by reviewing the bibliographies of the articles found, ensuring a thorough exploration of the subject matter related to the influence of smartphone usage on sleep patterns, mental health, and the academic performance of adolescents. 

Negative aspects of widespread smartphone use

People using smartphones have problems structuring their daily routines due to the disruptive impact of notifications and screen time. When it comes to students, sleep disturbances may in addition interfere with their ability to reach their classrooms, pay attention, and ability to focus and learn [7]. The result is an inefficient lifestyle with subpar academic outcomes, leading to stress and poor mental health. Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the impact of smartphone use on sleep. First, the bright light emitted suppresses the secretion of melatonin reducing sleep efficiency, delaying sleep onset, and disrupting circadian rhythms [7].

Second, sleep displacement occurs, when the smartphone is used as an unstructured leisure time activity with no predefined beginning and end point, unlike real-world games and other entertainment activities like attending theatrical performances, movies, and arcades [8].

Third, sleep can be affected by the content consumed through the smartphone such as activating music, arousing sexual or violent images, and video games requiring hyper-alertness to anticipate the required responses. Not surprisingly, studies have found that mobile phone usage is associated with short sleep duration, reduced sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. There is also some evidence to suggest that this relationship may be bidirectional, especially in adults where insomnia may be the cause and not the outcome of mobile use [8].

The Millennium Cohort Survey containing 11,553 responses suggested later bedtime and shorter nighttime sleep duration are associated with hyperactivity and inattention. Indeed sleep deprivation was found to exert a modulatory effect on the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation and depression in adolescents [9].

In particular, bedtime smartphone use is predictive of later rising time, longer sleep latency, and worse sleep efficiency. The screen light emitted by mobile phones is of short wavelength and towards the blue length of the light spectrum, which is likely to delay sleep onset for a long duration after exposure. Therefore, screen time guidelines have been evolved for the various age groups specifically affected by smartphone addiction [10]. According to the Australian Department of Health (ADH), the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the recommended screen time for adolescents should not exceed more than two hours per day [11]. 

Biological aspects

In mammals, multiple physiological, endocrine, behavioral, and molecular rhythms are governed by an endogenous clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. It runs freely to a cycle of around 40 minutes and, therefore, needs to be re-synchronized with 24 hours per day. To reset this clock and synchronize it with the solar day, the SCN is entrained daily, by the dark-light cycle to which the organism is exposed [12].

A phase shift in the circadian rhythms of the SCN results in alterations of both the bedtime and wake-up time of an individual which moves to a time earlier in the day (phase advance) or later in the day (phase delay). Light exposure suppresses the melatonin secretion and resets the phase of the SCN, which depends on the timing, intensity, wavelength, duration, and previous exposures to light or darkness. Light exposure, early in the biological night induces a phase delay while exposure late in the night and towards the early morning elicits a phase advance. Notably, these responses are present in blind people also, since the photoreceptors wired for the circadian entrainment are distinct from the rods and the cones of the visual system. These circadian photoreceptors have their peak sensitivity to a light wavelength in the range of 446 to 477 nm (visible short wavelength). Thus, a short wavelength approximately of 460 nm blue light exposure at night evokes a greater phase shift, thus alerting the responses and causing melatonin suppression when compared to other wavelength light in the visual range of 380 to 700 nm. Evidence indicates that these spectrally targeted blue light sources are more efficient in evoking circadian changes such as alertness, faster reaction time, attention lapses, and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while measuring the electrical activity of the brain [12].

Circadian photoreceptors in the retina use melanopsin as photopigment. Along with these receptors, there are specialized ganglion cells that project directly to the SCN. Human circadian rhythms like those of other diurnal species are sensitive to light throughout the biological day. Indeed there is no part of the biological day where light exposure does not affect the circadian rhythms. However, there is a phase delay period in the early biological night and a phase advance region in the late biological night with the transition region occurring late in the biological night. These shifts are evident even with light exposure for a couple of days in a week [12]. 

The human circadian system is sensitive to even low-intensity light especially if it follows many hours of darkness. Most studies show that modern humans get relatively little bright light exposure and spend most of the day in indoor light with an intensity of 200 lux. Such individuals become sensitive to even modest light intensity of 1,000 lux. In addition, even brief flashes of light can be incorporated into the human circadian rhythm if they occur after dark periods. Supplementary to the regular sleep times with darkness during the day, studies have shown that intermittent exposure to bright light throughout the night causes the aligning of the circadian rhythms with the nightshift work schedules [13,14].

The physiological functions of human beings exhibit approximately a 24-hour rhythm. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the molecular mechanism regulating these rhythms. This molecular mechanism comprises genes that increase the transcription of other genes, whose products, in turn, exert a negative feedback, on their gene expression. This autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop is present in every cell of the body. These feedback loops affect many genes that sub-serve the functioning and the timing of cell biology. These individual cellular clocks are kept in synchrony by the neural network that connects them to the central circadian clock of the organism [13,14].

In addition to this genetic mechanism, there have been circadian rhythms noted even in non-nucleated cells such as red blood cells. These non-genetic mechanisms could interact with the gene transcription-translation loops in unknown ways. These mechanisms point to the existence of the primal circadian clock that could be common to all species. The ability of visible light to synchronize with the biological clock of the photosynthetic marine dinoflagellate (Gonyaulax polyedra) has been known since 1958 [13,14].

Human chronobiology

The SCN plays a critical role in regulating photoperiodic behavior and physiology such as sleep, wakefulness, alertness, feeding, hunting/ aggressions, seasonal reproduction, body temperature, and hibernation [15].

A photoreceptive net consisting of the retinal ganglion cells and their axons (containing melanopsin), communicates directly with the brain influencing the circadian rhythms and the pupillary size, through projection to the SCN and the olivary pretectal nuclei, respectively. This photoreceptive system (as opposed to the functionally distinct visual system) encodes and transmits information about the ambient light intensity. Through this system, gross environmental illumination is integrated into the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neural behavioral systems of the human nervous system. Blue light appears to be the strongest synchronizing agent responsible for resetting the circadian rhythm, to keep the biological rhythms and the psycho-behavioral rhythms in phase with the solar day [14]. In humans, bright blue light between 0500 and 1700 hours causes a phase advance, while exposure outside this range results in a phase delay. In humans, the altering effects of blue-enriched light (such as those emitted from phone screens) appear to be stronger in the evenings and during the nighttime compared to the morning hours. Bright, continuous, blue light resets the SCN pacemakers which synchronizes the rhythms of subsidiary cellular clocks which would otherwise run free and go out of phase with each other and out of synchronism with the solar day [15].

Smartphones equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit visible blue light of short wavelength in the range of 446 to 484 nm. This screen light alters the circadian rhythms and also affects the ocular system: it reduces the melatonin hormone secretions (which is controlled by the SCN and the pineal gland) and decreases the core body temperature and the distal-proximal skin temperature (due to vasodilation of the distal blood vessels), leading to an increased level of sleepiness in the mornings and the evenings. Cortisol secretion by the pituitary gland is also influenced by the SCN. Normally there is a rapid increase in the blood cortisol level 30 to 60 minutes after awakening. One hour of exposure to mobile screen light of wavelength (414 to 800 lux) in dim light alters the cortisol awakening response. About 30 minutes of exposure to smartphone screen light with a frequency range of 0.50-3.99 Hz also reduces the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the brain, leading to mental disturbances, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety [16].

These findings have led to the effective use of light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual depression, bulimia, and circadian rhythm disorders related to sleep and dementia [17].

Public health importance

Sleep plays a crucial role in memory symbolization and integration, as noticed by researchers over a century ago. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have revealed several compelling findings. These findings indicate that sleep is essential for all the stages of learning. Sleep provides the ideal environment for neural network-level changes in memory representation and stabilizes the brain for long-term retention. Restorative sleep also prepares the brain for new learning [18]. 

These findings must be seen against the background of the widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone usage and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance [16]. Although no causative links have been shown to date, the International Agency for Research has identified some shift schedules that disrupt the circadian rhythms which serve as a potential carcinogen [19]. Melatonin suppression is also shown to be associated with diabetes mellitus type II [19].

A comparable study conducted in Japan aimed at evaluating the effects of mobile phone usage on sleep in adolescents. The results found that the increased phone use after turning off the lights before bed was linked to shorter sleep duration, poor sleep quality, insomnia, and greater daytime sleepiness [20]. This research highlighted the negative consequences of nighttime phone use on the overall sleep health of adolescents, emphasizing the importance of restricting screen time before sleep.

Multiple recent reviews found that adolescent mental health was significantly impacted by smartphone use. Chronic sleep deprivation leading to reduced cognitive ability/ school performance, social isolation, and self-harm was identified by multiple cross-sectional, longitudinal, and empirical studies in this population [21-23]. Associated comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and excessive alcohol intake were also identified in this population [24,25].

Conclusions

The review was able to flag critical and clinically relevant concerns of public health importance related to the continuous usage of smartphones. Research has proved that the use of smartphones could disrupt circadian rhythms leading to disturbances in lifestyle, sleep, and multiple cellular biological processes.

It is mandatory to impose screen time restrictions and document the levels of impairment related to sleep patterns, negative mood swings, and memory loss produced in the learning population and adolescents. Counseling students about the detrimental consequences of smartphone use before bedtime and the significance of getting sufficient sleep for the achievement of academic success is essential. Some researchers have already found that restriction of mobile phone use for 30 minutes before bedtime has a greater potential for improving sleep, overall mental health, and academic performance of students.

The clinical importance of evaluating smartphone usage patterns in the field of mental health and de-addiction is also highlighted in this clinically oriented review. Despite its many potential benefits, such as social connectivity, educational tools, and financial applications, smartphone addiction has been shown to negatively impact the overall health of adolescents.

Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance. The implications of circadian disruption for learning populations, such as university students and professionals training for careers in medicine, and other critical occupations, cannot be overstated. This review highlights the possible negative consequences of smartphone use on overall sleep health while emphasizing the importance of studying its impact, on mental health and learning outcomes, in different populations.\xa0The review aimed to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and the consequences for their academic achievement. The method used was a comprehensive search strategy using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases with\xa0appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.\n\nKeywords: adolescents, learning, psychiatry & mental health, sleep pattern, smartphone usage\n\nIntroduction and background\n\nMobile phones are mass-produced electronic\xa0devices\xa0that are an integral part of our lives due to\xa0benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment, including games. They are popular, especially because\xa0they provide these\xa0benefits instantly, due to their portability and size [1].\n\nSmartphones, on\xa0the other hand,\xa0are\xa0technologically more advanced mobile devices, which can perform many of the\xa0functions of a computer, in addition to those of mobile phones, while having the same convenience and form factor.\xa0Given the multifaceted applications of a smartphone, it has also progressively become an intrinsic part of our lives and relationships.\xa0\n\nThe many benefits of a smartphone\xa0like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are, however, balanced by negative health consequences, including neck pain, accidents, poor mental health, and sleep disturbances [2]. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. A systematic review of Indian adolescents revealed that smartphone addiction among adolescents was 39% to 44% on average.\xa0Nearly 300 million of the Indian population uses smartphones [3]. Surveys suggest that up to 50% of teens and 27% of their parents feel that they may be addicted to mobile phones [4].\n\nThese negative health consequences are repeatedly highlighted by the popular press. However, it must\xa0be kept in mind that many of these negative health consequences of smartphone use are speculative and alarmist. Mental health professionals need to have actionable evidence to counsel their clients in a balanced and appropriate manner based on available scientific evidence [5-6].\xa0\n\nThe objective of this clinically oriented comprehensive review was to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and its consequences on their academic achievement. The methodology used was a comprehensive search strategy in Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases using appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.\n\nReview\n\nMethodology\n\nTo conduct this review, a comprehensive search was undertaken using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Keywords include “adolescents”, “psychiatry and mental health”, “learning”, “sleep pattern”, and "smartphone usage”. The search results were supplemented by reviewing the bibliographies of the articles found, ensuring a thorough exploration of the subject matter related to the influence of smartphone usage on sleep patterns, mental health, and the academic performance of adolescents.\xa0\n\nNegative aspects of widespread smartphone use\n\nPeople using smartphones have problems structuring their daily routines due to the disruptive impact of notifications and screen time. When it comes to students, sleep disturbances may in addition interfere with their ability to reach their classrooms, pay attention, and ability to focus and learn [7]. The result is an inefficient lifestyle with subpar academic outcomes, leading to stress and poor mental health.\xa0Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which\xa0are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially\xa0useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the impact of smartphone use on sleep. First, the bright light emitted suppresses the secretion of melatonin reducing sleep efficiency, delaying sleep onset, and disrupting circadian rhythms [7].\n\nSecond, sleep displacement occurs, when the smartphone is used as an unstructured leisure time activity with no predefined beginning and end point, unlike real-world games and other entertainment activities like attending theatrical performances, movies, and arcades [8].\n\nThird, sleep can be affected by the content consumed through the smartphone such as activating music, arousing sexual or violent images, and video games requiring hyper-alertness to anticipate the required responses. Not surprisingly, studies have found that\xa0mobile phone usage is associated with short sleep duration, reduced\xa0sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. There is also\xa0some evidence to suggest that this relationship may be bidirectional, especially in adults\xa0where insomnia may be the cause and not the outcome of mobile use [8].\n\nThe Millennium Cohort Survey containing 11,553 responses suggested later bedtime and shorter nighttime sleep duration\xa0are associated with hyperactivity and inattention. Indeed sleep deprivation was found to exert a modulatory effect on the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation and depression in adolescents [9].\n\nIn particular, bedtime smartphone use is predictive of later rising time, longer sleep latency, and worse sleep efficiency. The screen light emitted by mobile phones is of short wavelength and towards the blue length of the light spectrum, which is likely to delay sleep onset for a long duration after exposure. Therefore, screen time guidelines\xa0have been evolved for the various age groups specifically affected by smartphone addiction [10].\xa0According to the Australian Department of Health (ADH), the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the recommended screen time for\xa0adolescents should not exceed more than two hours per day [11].\xa0\n\nBiological aspects\n\nIn mammals, multiple physiological, endocrine, behavioral, and molecular rhythms are governed by an endogenous clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. It runs freely to a cycle of around 40 minutes and, therefore, needs to be re-synchronized\xa0with 24 hours per day.\xa0To reset this clock and synchronize it with the solar day, the SCN\xa0is entrained daily, by the dark-light cycle to which the organism is exposed [12].\n\nA phase shift in the circadian rhythms of the SCN results in alterations of both the bedtime and wake-up time of an individual which moves to a time earlier in the day (phase advance) or later in the day (phase delay). Light exposure suppresses the melatonin secretion and resets the\xa0phase of the SCN, which depends on the timing, intensity, wavelength, duration, and previous exposures to light or darkness. Light exposure, early in the biological night induces a phase delay while exposure late in the night and towards the early morning elicits a phase advance.\xa0Notably,\xa0these responses are\xa0present in blind people also,\xa0since the photoreceptors wired for the circadian entrainment are distinct from the rods and the cones of the visual system. These circadian photoreceptors have their peak sensitivity to a light wavelength\xa0in the range of 446 to 477 nm (visible short wavelength). Thus, a short wavelength approximately of 460 nm blue light exposure at night evokes a greater phase shift, thus alerting the responses and causing melatonin suppression when compared to other wavelength light in the visual range of 380 to 700 nm. Evidence indicates that these spectrally targeted blue light sources are more efficient in evoking circadian changes such as alertness, faster reaction time, attention lapses, and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while\xa0measuring the electrical activity of the brain [12].\n\nCircadian\xa0photoreceptors in the retina use melanopsin as photopigment. Along with these receptors, there are specialized ganglion cells that project directly to the SCN. Human circadian rhythms like those of other diurnal species are sensitive\xa0to light throughout the biological day. Indeed there is no part of the biological day where light exposure does not affect the circadian rhythms. However, there is a phase delay period\xa0in the early biological night and a phase\xa0advance region in the late biological night with the transition\xa0region occurring late in the biological night. These shifts are evident even with light exposure for a couple of days in a week [12].\xa0\n\nThe human circadian system is sensitive to even low-intensity light especially if it follows many hours of darkness. Most studies show that modern humans get relatively little bright light exposure and spend most of the day in indoor light with an intensity of 200 lux. Such individuals become sensitive to even modest light intensity of 1,000 lux. In addition, even brief flashes of light can be incorporated into the human circadian rhythm if they occur after dark periods. Supplementary to the regular sleep times with darkness during the day, studies have shown that intermittent exposure to bright light throughout the night causes the aligning of the circadian rhythms with the nightshift work schedules [13,14].\n\nThe physiological functions of human beings exhibit approximately a 24-hour rhythm. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the molecular mechanism regulating these rhythms. This molecular mechanism comprises genes that increase the transcription of other genes, whose products, in turn, exert a negative feedback, on their gene expression. This autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop is present in every cell of the body. These feedback loops affect many genes that sub-serve the functioning and the timing of cell biology. These individual cellular clocks are kept in synchrony by the neural network that connects them to the central circadian clock of the organism\xa0[13,14].\n\nIn addition to this genetic mechanism, there have been circadian rhythms noted even in non-nucleated cells such as red blood cells. These non-genetic mechanisms could interact with the gene transcription-translation loops in unknown ways. These mechanisms point to the existence of the primal circadian clock\xa0that could be common to all species. The ability of visible light to synchronize with\xa0the biological clock of the photosynthetic marine dinoflagellate (Gonyaulax polyedra) has been known since 1958 [13,14].\n\nHuman chronobiology\n\nThe SCN\xa0plays a critical role in regulating photoperiodic behavior and physiology such as sleep, wakefulness, alertness, feeding, hunting/ aggressions, seasonal reproduction, body temperature, and hibernation [15].\n\nA photoreceptive net\xa0consisting of the retinal ganglion cells and their axons (containing melanopsin), communicates directly with the brain influencing the circadian rhythms and the pupillary size, through projection to the SCN and the olivary pretectal nuclei, respectively. This photoreceptive system (as opposed to the functionally distinct visual system) encodes and transmits information about the ambient light intensity. Through this system, gross environmental illumination is integrated into the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neural behavioral systems of the human\xa0nervous system. Blue light appears to be the strongest synchronizing agent responsible for resetting the circadian rhythm, to keep the biological rhythms\xa0and the psycho-behavioral rhythms in phase with the solar day [14].\xa0In humans, bright blue light between 0500 and 1700 hours causes a phase advance, while exposure outside this range results in a phase delay. In humans, the altering effects of blue-enriched light (such as those emitted from phone screens) appear to be stronger in the evenings and during the nighttime compared to the morning hours. Bright, continuous, blue light\xa0resets the SCN pacemakers which synchronizes the rhythms of subsidiary cellular clocks which would otherwise run free and go out of phase with each other and out of synchronism with the solar day [15].\n\nSmartphones equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit visible blue light of short wavelength in the range of 446 to 484 nm.\xa0This screen light alters the circadian rhythms and also affects the ocular system: it reduces the melatonin hormone secretions (which is controlled by the SCN and the pineal gland) and decreases the core body temperature and the distal-proximal skin temperature (due to vasodilation of the distal blood vessels), leading to an increased level of sleepiness in the mornings and the evenings. Cortisol secretion by the pituitary gland is also influenced by the SCN. Normally there is a rapid increase in the blood cortisol level 30 to 60 minutes after awakening. One hour of exposure to mobile screen light of wavelength (414 to 800 lux) in dim light\xa0alters the cortisol awakening response. About 30 minutes of exposure to smartphone screen light with a frequency range of 0.50-3.99 Hz also reduces the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the brain, leading to mental disturbances, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety [16].\n\nThese findings have led to the effective use of light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual depression, bulimia, and circadian rhythm disorders related to sleep and dementia [17].\n\nPublic health importance\n\nSleep plays a crucial role in memory symbolization and integration, as noticed by\xa0researchers\xa0over a century ago. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have revealed several compelling findings. These findings indicate that sleep is essential for all the stages of learning. Sleep provides the ideal environment for neural network-level changes in memory representation and stabilizes the brain for long-term retention. Restorative sleep also prepares the brain for new learning [18].\xa0\n\nThese findings must be seen against the background of the widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone usage and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance [16]. Although no causative links have been shown to date, the International Agency for Research has identified some\xa0shift schedules\xa0that disrupt the\xa0circadian rhythms which serve as a\xa0potential carcinogen [19]. Melatonin suppression is also shown to be associated with diabetes mellitus type II [19].\n\nA comparable study conducted in Japan aimed at evaluating the effects of mobile phone usage on sleep in adolescents. The results found that the increased phone use after turning off the lights before bed was linked to shorter sleep duration, poor\xa0sleep quality, insomnia, and greater daytime sleepiness [20]. This research highlighted the negative consequences of nighttime phone use on the overall sleep health of adolescents, emphasizing the importance of restricting screen time before sleep.\n\nMultiple recent reviews found that adolescent mental health was significantly impacted by smartphone use. Chronic sleep deprivation leading to reduced cognitive ability/ school performance, social isolation, and self-harm was identified by multiple cross-sectional, longitudinal, and empirical studies in this population [21-23]. Associated comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and excessive alcohol intake were also identified in this population [24,25].\n\nConclusions\n\nThe review was able to flag critical and clinically relevant concerns\xa0of public health importance related to the continuous usage of smartphones. Research has proved that the use of smartphones could disrupt circadian rhythms leading to disturbances in lifestyle, sleep, and multiple cellular biological processes.\n\nIt is mandatory to impose screen time restrictions and document the levels of impairment related to sleep patterns, negative mood swings, and memory loss produced in the learning population and adolescents. Counseling students about the detrimental consequences of smartphone use before bedtime and the significance of getting sufficient sleep for the achievement of academic success is essential. Some researchers have already found that restriction of mobile phone use for 30 minutes before bedtime\xa0has a greater potential for improving sleep, overall mental health, and academic performance of students.\n\nThe clinical importance of evaluating smartphone usage patterns in the field of mental health and de-addiction is also highlighted in this clinically oriented review. Despite its many potential benefits, such as social connectivity, educational tools, and financial applications, smartphone addiction has been shown to negatively impact the overall health of adolescents.\n\nDisclosures\n\nConflicts of interest: In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:\n\nPayment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\nFinancial relationships: All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\nOther relationships: All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConcept and design:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nDrafting of the manuscript:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nCritical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nSupervision:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nReferences\n1.Smartphone addiction among university students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Abstract

(1) Background: Sleep is considered to be a complex condition for human beings, with the aim of ensuring physical and psychological recovery. Technology, including the cell phone, is a tool for teenagers that ensures they are always available to interact, even at night. This study aims to understand the influence of the use of smartphones on adolescent sleep quality. (2) Methods: The guidelines proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed. The search was conducted in October 2022 through the EBSCOhost platform, with access to the CINAHL Complete and Medline databases and through the b-On database. (3) Results: The use of electronic equipment plays an important role in adolescents’ lives. There is a negative relationship between the use of electronic equipment, such as smartphones, and sleep, for reducing both the quality and quantity of sleep. There is also a relationship between nighttime smartphone use, insufficient sleep, and mental health problems. (4) Conclusions: The use of new technologies at night causes a change in the behavior of adolescents with repercussions in terms of the quality of sleep and sleep duration and consequent well-being and performance during the day.

1. Introduction

Sleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].

In a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).

The circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].

As it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.

The World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.

For good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.

Nowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].

This permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).

The Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.

Considering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.

2. Materials and Methods

A Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).

Using the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”

The search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.

The articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.

Among the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.

All articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.

Regarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.

All studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.

The analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].

Johansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.

In fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

4. Discussion

Adolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].

Technological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].

Schweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

The constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.

If, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.

The high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.

In fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.

The studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.

Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.

According to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].

Many authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.

In Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).

Meeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).

This study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.

Therefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.

Nursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).

Johansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].

In this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].

It is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.

5. Conclusions

It was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.

The influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.

It becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.

Based on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.

6. Limitations/Future Prospects

Limitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.

Introduction\n\nSleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].\n\nIn a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).\n\nThe circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].\n\nAs it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.\n\nThe World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.\n\nFor good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.\n\nNowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].\n\nThis permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).\n\nThe Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.\n\nConsidering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nA Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).\n\nUsing the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”\n\nThe search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.\n\nThe articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.\n\nAmong the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nPRISMA of study selection and inclusion process [10].\n\nAfter the selection of studies, they were evaluated critically by applying assessment grids of the level of evidence, reliability, and relevance, which allowed us to classify the studies found (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.\n\nCritical evaluation of the results of the included studies according to the critical evaluation verification list by Joanna Briggs Institute [11].\n\nArticles\tQ1\tQ2\tQ3\tQ4\tQ5\tQ6\tQ7\tQ8\tQ9\tQ10\tResult\nTavernier et al.

One month after, the students were visited a second time and completed the same questionnaire.\nOpen in a new tab\n\nAll articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.\n\nRegarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.\n\nAll studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.\n\nThe analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].\n\nJohansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.\n\nIn fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nLikewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAdolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].\n\nTechnological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].\n\nSchweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nThe constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.\n\nIf, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.\n\nThe high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.\n\nIn fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.\n\nThe studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.\n\nLike these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.\n\nAccording to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].\n\nMany authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.\n\nIn Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).\n\nMeeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).\n\nThis study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.\n\nTherefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.\n\nNursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).\n\nJohansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].\n\nIn this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].\n\nIt is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIt was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.\n\nThe influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.\n\nIt becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.\n\nBased on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.\n\n6. Limitations/Future Prospects\n\nLimitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity.

Abstract
Background

College students are the backbone of future national construction and shoulder the hope of the future development of the country and the nation. Smartphone addiction among college students will not only affect their own mental health and learning attitude, but it will also significantly affect their future academic achievement, academic emotion and academic engagement. However, the relationship between academic anxiety and academic control and academic achievement, as well as their internal mechanisms and boundary conditions, has received little attention. The purpose of this study is to examine whether and how smartphone addiction influences academic achievement.

Purpose

This study aims to explore the mechanistic role of academic anxiety and academic control in the influence of smartphone addiction on academic achievement in college students, and hopes that the results can guide education and teaching.

Methods

A sample of N=2097 participants, this study evaluated the relationship between smartphone addiction, academic control, academic anxiety and academic achievement among college students, and the participants filled in the college students’ smartphone addiction scale, academic control questionnaire, academic anxiety questionnaire and grade points.

Results

(1) There is a significant negative correlation between smartphone addiction and academic achievement; (2) academic anxiety serves as a complete mediator in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement; (3) the interaction between smartphone addiction and academic control moderates academic anxiety, with higher levels of academic control associated with a weaker impact of smartphone addiction on academic anxiety; (4) academic control also moderates the mediating role of academic anxiety between smartphone addiction and academic achievement, demonstrating a moderated mediating effect.

Conclusion

Smartphone addiction had negative direct effect on academic achievement, as well as completely mediating effect through academic anxiety. Academic control moderated the relationship between of smartphone addiction and academic anxiety. This study enriches the research on the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement in theory, and has important guiding significance for education and teaching in practice.

Keywords: smartphone addiction, academic anxiety, sense of academic control, academic achievement

Introduction

In the information age, smartphones play an indispensable role as mobile terminals in the lives and studies of college students. Smartphones have become essential tools for college students to access information, engage in games, entertainment, and social activities. However, while smartphones bring convenience, they also give rise to new psychosocial problems, such as smartphone addiction and other problematic smartphone usage behaviors.1 While previous research has explored the antecedents of smartphone addiction behavior among college students,2,3 and its relationship with depression and anxiety,4,5 few studies have delved into the mechanism by which smartphone addiction affects academic achievement in college students, considering the factors of academic control and academic anxiety. For example, research by Qin et al showed that negative emotions such as anxiety and stress could predict smartphone addiction among college students, but the results also showed that there was no significant relationship between academic achievement and smartphone addiction.6 The findings of Amez et al show that for each additional unit of smartphone use, the test score decreases by a corresponding value, and the proportion of people who pass the test also decreases.7 Therefore, the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement of college students needs to be further studied. The Compensatory Internet Use Theory suggests that individuals may resort to excessive smartphone usage as a coping mechanism to alleviate negative emotions when faced with adverse life situations, effectively using smartphones as a means of escaping from real-life challenges.8 When college students encounter difficulties in their academic lives, such as academic pressure or interpersonal issues, they may develop a dependence on smartphones, increasing the likelihood of smartphone addiction. Research has shown that negative emotions and other factors may contribute to a heightened tendency towards smartphone addiction.9 College students often experience intense emotions during their learning processes,10 which can directly impact their behavior, learning outcomes, and personal growth. Therefore, it is plausible that academic anxiety negatively predicts academic achievement, providing a theoretical basis for investigating the relationship between smartphone addiction, academic anxiety, and academic achievement.

The Control-Value Theory places learners’ emotional factors at its core, positing that academic emotions are influenced by the learning environment and value evaluation factors. These emotions significantly impact academic achievements.11 Value evaluation factors encompass a learner’s level of control over the learning process and the value they place on learning activities and objectives. Mastery goal orientation, an important component of value evaluation, reflects a learner’s pursuit of self-improvement and knowledge mastery during the learning process. Academic affective factors encompass emotions directly related to a learner’s learning, classroom teaching, and academic achievement.12 This theory offers a multifaceted perspective on the relationship between the learning environment, value evaluation, emotional factors, and academic achievement. It aids in comprehensively and profoundly understanding the causes of learners’ psychological factors and their impact on academic achievements, providing a foundation for exploring the mechanisms linking the learning environment, academic control, academic emotions, and academic achievements. Given the potential significance of smartphone addiction on academic achievement, this study aims to explore the relationship between college students’ smartphone addiction, academic anxiety, academic control, and academic achievement.

Based on control-value theory and compensatory network use theory, this study constructs a conceptual model (see Figure 1), which examines the “how” and “when” of college students’ smartphone addiction affect college students’ academic achievement, with three main objectives:(1) to examine the correlation between smartphone addiction and academic achievement among college students; (2) to examine whether academic anxiety plays a mediating role between college students’ smartphone addiction and academic achievement; (3) to explore whether the sense of academic control can regulate the mediating first half of college students’ smartphone addiction and academic anxiety.

Conceptual model.

Hypothesis
College Students’ Smartphone Addiction and Academic Achievement

The term “smartphone addiction” initially emerged in research related to driving safety. As smartphones became increasingly ubiquitous and their impact on individuals grew, the concept of problematic smartphone use, akin to addictive behaviors such as gambling, gaming, shopping, and internet usage, gained attention among researchers.13 Scholars like Bianchi and others propose that excessive smartphone usage is the central characteristic of smartphone addiction, with individuals becoming obsessed with smartphones due to various motivations.2 According to Chóliz, specific features of smartphone addiction include high communication costs due to excessive smartphone use, conflicts with parents arising from smartphone use, interference with other activities such as learning, increasing time spent on smartphones to derive pleasure, and emotional fluctuations when smartphone use is restricted.14

In light of these definitions, this study defines smartphone addiction as an individual’s inability to control the timing and location of smartphone use, excessive dependence on smartphones, and a range of inappropriate behaviors. These behaviors encompass withdrawal symptoms (negative physiological and psychological reactions when individuals do not use smartphones), heightened preoccupation with smartphones (where individuals prioritize smartphones in their thoughts and activities), increased reliance on smartphones for social interactions, and mood swings linked to smartphone usage.

Academic achievement plays a vital role in education as it is one of the most important outcomes of the educational process. It serves as the key for students to understand their talents, abilities, and potential.15 Generally, academic achievement is manifested as academic performance in school.

Excessive use of smartphones can negatively impact students’ academic performance. Individuals with high levels of smartphone addiction have a higher probability of procrastination16 and consequently, lower academic performance.17 Students who abstain from using smartphones in class tend to pay more attention to their studies, resulting in higher scores on knowledge tests.18 Smartphone use during study has been associated with lower grade point averages,19 and frequent smartphone use has led to a significant decline in students’ academic performance.20 In daily study and life, if college students cannot effectively resist the temptation of smartphones and indulge in uncontrolled smartphone use, often referred to as smartphone addiction, it may have a detrimental effect on their academic achievements. This paper proposes the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: Smartphone addiction in college students has a significant negative correlation with academic achievement.

Mediating Role of Academic Anxiety

Academic anxiety encompasses negative emotions such as restlessness and neuro-emotions (affective components), worry (cognition), avoidance motivation (motivation), anxious facial expressions (expressiveness), and peripheral physiological activation (physiological).21 It encompasses emotions like worry, nervousness, and restlessness related to academic performance in a school environment, including study anxiety, classroom anxiety, and test anxiety.22–24

In studies examining the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety among college students, it has been found that anxiety and smartphone addiction are significantly positively correlated. Negative emotions can exacerbate problematic smartphone behavior.25,26 Psychological distress, including anxiety, among college students, can lead to excessive smartphone use as a coping mechanism, as individuals may turn to smartphones to alleviate negative emotions.27–29 Conversely, when individuals refrain from using smartphones or have their smartphone usage restricted, they often experience feelings of loss, irritability, restlessness, and anxiety.30 Research by McCann suggests a negative correlation between state anxiety and academic achievement.31 Many studies have shown that anxiety is significantly negatively correlated with academic achievement,32,33 and the interaction between anxiety and physiological anxiety levels in adolescents can affect academic achievement,34 students with reading and math learning difficulties both reported higher levels of anxiety.35 Anxiety, especially in the context of foreign language learning, has been found to be related to poorer language proficiency.36 In a study by Da et al exploring the role of mathematics anxiety in the relationship between smartphone addiction and mathematical achievement, it was discovered that mathematical anxiety mediated between smartphone addiction and mathematical achievement. The intensity of smartphone addiction can regulate mathematical anxiety, and in turn, affect mathematical achievement.37 This paper proposes the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2: College students’ academic anxiety mediates the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement.

Moderating Role of Academic Control

The term “academic control” was first introduced by Perry in 1991. Academic control refers to a student’s belief in their ability to predict and influence their academic performance. It is an individual’s perception of their capacity to control and forecast academic outcomes to a certain extent.38,39 Sense of academic control for college students entails feelings and perceptions of their ability to influence academic outcomes, a belief in their capability to achieve academic goals, and the conviction that academic success depends on factors they can control. Additionally, it involves recognizing the factors that contribute to academic success and experiencing a sense of gradual progress toward goals through hard work. This fosters a sense of personal strength and value.40

Data from Respondek et al suggests that students who use smartphones for more than 7 hours per week tend to pay less attention to their academic abilities. Excessive smartphone usage can have a detrimental effect on students’ sense of academic control. Consequently, students with low academic control may predict higher levels of anxiety,41 whereas students with a high sense of academic control tend to experience lower levels of academic anxiety and are more likely to allocate more time to learning and less time to smartphone use. Research by Kang et al shows that anxiety plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between a sense of academic control and self-regulated learning.42 Students with a strong sense of academic control experience lower stress,43 and anxiety-induced increased arousal, such as distraction, can adversely affect cognitive executive control.44 Sense of academic control is positively associated with positive emotions such as enjoyment and is negatively correlated with negative emotions like anxiety.45 Sense of academic control is especially important for college students to adapt to the learning environment and overcome stress.46,47

Building on the above hypotheses, our study further infers that there may be a moderating effect on the mediating role of college students’ sense of academic control in academic anxiety between smartphone addiction and academic achievement. In other words, when college students have a higher level of academic control, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement through academic anxiety is correspondingly weaker. Conversely, when the level of academic control is lower, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction through academic anxiety on academic achievement is stronger. Therefore, the hypothesis is put forward:

Hypothesis 3: College students’ sense of academic control moderates the mediating effect of academic anxiety. In essence, a higher level of academic control weakens the mediating effect, while a lower level of academic control strengthens it.

Research Methods
Participants and Procedure

The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethical Committee of Liaoning Normal University and all participants provided informed consent. Participants were selected with cluster sampling method with the school as a sampling unit from 20 schools in Liaoning Normal University. The cluster sampling method is used to obtain the data information of a group more comprehensively, which is easy to organize and implement, and can save manpower and material resources. This study involved undergraduates from Liaoning Normal University, including students from the Department of Education, the School of Government Management, the School of Psychology, the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, the School of Mathematics, the School of Foreign Chinese, the School of Fine Arts, and so on. A total of 2097 questionnaires were distributed using purposive sampling and the college-student duality method. After eliminating 41 invalid questionnaires with missing or inconsistent answers, we obtained 2056 (98.04%) valid responses. Of the participants, 407 (19.8%) were male, and 1649 (80.2%) were female. Additionally, 1210 (58.9%) were enrolled in humanities and social sciences, while 846 (41.1%) were in science, engineering, and medicine. Moreover, 849 (41.3%) were registered in rural areas, and 1207 (58.7%) were registered in urban areas.

Measures
Smartphone Addiction

We used the “College Students’ Smartphone Addiction Tendency Scale” developed by Xiong Jie, Zhou Zongkui, Chen Wu, You Zhiqi, and Zhai Ziyan in 2012.48 The scale has a total of 16 items encompassing four dimensions, which are withdrawal symptom, conspicuous behavior, social comfort and mood change., items such as “I feel more fulfilled in my life with more phone calls and text messages” and “I feel lonely without a smartphone.” Participants rated these statements on a scale of 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“very conform”). Higher total scores indicate more intense feelings of smartphone addiction. The internal consistency confidence of the scale in this study was α=0.94.

Academic Anxiety

We employed the Academic Anxiety Scale from the Achievement Emotional Questionnaire (AEQ) as developed by Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, and Perry in 2002.49 This scale originally contained 39 items, but after the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis after of the initial test data recovery, we retained 21 items with a total of three dimensions, which are classroom anxiety, learning anxiety and test anxiety, items such as “Sitting in class, I feel uneasy” and “I am nervous in class”. Participants rated their responses on a scale of 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“very conform”). Higher total scores indicate more intense feelings of academic anxiety. The internal consistency confidence of the scale in this study was α=0.98. The structural validity of the scale was assessed, resulting in X2/df=4.82, GFI=0.974, NFI=0.981, IFI=0.985, CFI=0.985, and RMSEA=0.043 as fitting indices.

Sense of Academic Control

We used the revised Academic Control Scale developed by Perry, Hladkyj, Pekrun, and Pelletier in 2001 and adapted by Ju Yachan in 2012.50,51 The scale originally contained 8 items, but we retained 6 items after initial testing to suit our research context. With a total of two dimensions, which are internal action control and external environment control, items statements include “I think I have a great degree of control over my academic performance” and “The more effort I put into my studies, the better my academic performance will be”. Participants rated these statements on a scale of 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“very conform”). The reverse scoring questions are 4, 5, and 6. Higher total scores indicate less intense feelings of external environment control. The internal consistency confidence of the scale in this study was α=0.72.

Academic Achievement

Academic achievement was measured based on university students’ achievement points, which were weighted in the analysis.

Results
Common Method Variance

We conducted the Harman univariate test, as recommended by Jakobsen and Jensen, to assess the extent of common method bias in the data. The results indicated that there were seven characteristic factors with values greater than 1. However, the first factor explained only 37.46% of the variation, which did not exceed the 40% threshold suggested by Jakobsen and Jensen. Therefore, we concluded that there was no serious common method bias in this study.52

Descriptive Statistical Analysis of Each Variable

Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients for each study variable. The results reveal that the statistically significant negative correlation between smartphone addiction and academic achievement is very low (r= −0.05 p<0.05). Furthermore, smartphone addiction is significantly positively correlated with academic anxiety (r=0.61, p<0.01), while academic anxiety is significantly negatively correlated with academic achievement (r=−0.11, p<0.01). Additionally, sense of academic control is significantly positively correlated with academic achievement (r=0.24, p<0.01). As a result, hypothesis 1 has been preliminarily verified, providing a solid foundation for subsequent hierarchical regression analysis.

Testing of Research Hypotheses

Firstly, hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the simple and direct impact of smartphone addiction on academic achievement among college students. The data revealed that, after controlling for demographic variables (gender, major, domicile place, annual household economic income, monthly disposable income in school, parenting style and graduation plan), smartphone addiction among college students had a significant negative effect on academic achievement (b=−0.05, p<0.05), confirming the verification of hypothesis 1.

Secondly, we employed the SPSS macro program PROCESS, developed by Hayes, to analyze the simple mediating effect of academic anxiety on the relationship between college students’ smartphone addiction and academic achievement (as shown in Table 2). The analysis results indicated that, after accounting for demographic variables (gender, major, domicile place, annual household economic income, monthly disposable income in school, parenting style and graduation plan), smartphone addiction among college students had a significant positive effect on academic anxiety (M1, b=0.65, p<0.01). Furthermore, when smartphone addiction and academic anxiety were simultaneously included in the regression model, the results demonstrated that academic anxiety significantly influenced academic achievement (M2, b=−0.1, p<0.01). Additionally, the nonparametric percentile Bootstrap method, corrected for bias, was employed to assess the mediating effect of academic anxiety. The results indicated that the mediating effect of academic anxiety was significant in the pathway from college students’ smartphone addiction to academic achievement, with an indirect effect value of −0.067 (p<0.01) and a 95% confidence interval of Boot (−0.069, −0.018). The confidence interval did not include zero, confirming the significance of the pure mediating effect of academic anxiety and thus verifying hypothesis 2.

Subsequently, this study employed the PROCESS macro program to investigate the moderating effect of academic control on the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety, as well as its moderating effect on the mediating role of academic anxiety (as presented in Table 3). The analysis outcomes indicated that the interaction effect between smartphone addiction and the level of academic control in the regression model achieved statistical significance (M3, b=−0.28, p<0.01). In other words, the interaction between smartphone addiction and academic control significantly influenced the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety.

To provide a more intuitive representation of the moderating effect in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety, the researchers created a simple slope diagram illustrating the regulatory impact (refer to Figure 2). As depicted, when college students possess a strong sense of academic control, the positive association between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety is attenuated. Conversely, when college students exhibit a weak sense of academic control, the positive relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety becomes more pronounced. This observation validates hypothesis 3.

Moderating effect of the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety.

To further investigate the moderating effect of the sense of academic control on the mediating influence of academic anxiety, a detailed analysis was conducted (refer to Table 4). The outcomes indicated that when college students possessed a strong sense of academic control, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement through academic anxiety was diminished (ρ=0.40, Boot 95% CI does not include 0). Conversely, when college students exhibited a weak sense of academic control, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement through academic anxiety remained low (ρ=0.69, Boot 95% CI does not include 0).Following the moderated mediation effect analysis method proposed by Hayes (2015), the parameter Index was tested, resulting in a value of 0.02 with a Boot 95% confidence interval of (0.01, 0.03), which does not contain 0. In summary, these findings demonstrate that the mediating effect of academic anxiety in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement is subject to regulation by the sense of academic control, confirming the empirical support for hypothesis 3.

Discussion
Direct Effect of College Students’ Smartphone Addiction and Academic Achievement

It is evident that smartphone addiction among college students has a detrimental effect on their academic achievement. This aligns with numerous prior studies supporting this notion. For instance, as supported by 36 reviewed studies,53 smartphone use was negatively correlated with students’ academic performance. Samaha and Hawi noted that individuals with high levels of smartphone addiction tended to achieve lower academic outcomes.17 This conclusion is in line with the media dependence theory,54 suggesting that the more individuals rely on media, such as smartphones, to meet their needs, the greater the impact of media on them. At the same time, in line with this conclusion, the uncontrolled use of smartphones leads to a series of physical and mental problems in students, as well as reduced academic achievement.55 Moreover, his study reaffirms the negative effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement among college students. Smartphone addiction consumes substantial time originally designated for learning activities, consequently jeopardizing the quality of task completion. Additionally, students may develop an excessive psychological dependence on smartphones, seeking solace and understanding, which detracts from their academic pursuits. Therefore, it is imperative to guide students in adopting a balanced approach to smartphone usage to mitigate the prevalence of smartphone addiction.

The reason for the low negative correlation coefficient between smartphone addiction and academic performance may be that college students use mobile phones for studying, and students spend a lot of time using smartphones to acquire knowledge and improve their academic performance, but they cannot reasonably control the use time, resulting in smartphone addiction.

Mediating Role of Academic Anxiety

Academic anxiety among college students plays a pivotal mediating role in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement. Smartphone addiction not only directly affects students’ academic performance but also indirectly influences academic achievement by exacerbating academic anxiety. This perspective, grounded in academic emotions, enhances our understanding of the connection between smartphone addiction and academic achievement, better reflecting the real academic experiences of students. This conclusion aligns with previous findings,56 which suggest that anxiety can drive individuals to use smartphones excessively as a coping mechanism, thereby predicting smartphone addiction.36,57 Students developed learning anxiety in foreign language classrooms, and the higher the level of anxiety themselves, the lower the foreign language proficiency.37 Furthermore, it is consistent with control-value theory.11 This research highlights that negative academic emotions like academic anxiety can significantly impact students’ academic achievement, broadening our perspective on the relationship between academic anxiety and academic performance.

Moderating Role of Sense of Academic Control

The study found that college students’ sense of academic control significantly moderates the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety. Additionally, this sense of academic control also moderates the overall mediating effect of academic anxiety. These findings have important implications for educational psychologists and researchers. It suggests that strategies or interventions aimed at enhancing students’ sense of academic control can potentially reduce academic anxiety, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of smartphone addiction on academic achievement. Students with a strong sense of academic control are more likely to allocate more time to their studies, resulting in lower anxiety levels.58 In line with this, students who exhibit good self-control are less susceptible to smartphone addiction.59 Students who use smartphones for more than 7 hours per week will pay less attention to ability in the curriculum, and excessive use of smartphones will have a harmful effect on students’ sense of academic control, that is, smartphone addiction will lead to a decrease in academic control. A good sense of self-control moderated the relationship between personal growth initiative and the risk of smartphone addiction, thereby reducing the risk of smartphone addiction; this is also consistent with the results of the study of 571 college students: smartphone addiction has a negative impact on individual self-control and further leads to poor academic performance;60 Embodies the idea of Compensatory Internet Use Theory,61 students gain comfort and understanding in the Internet by using smartphones to escape negative emotions such as academic anxiety during academic activities; while control-value theory, students with the high sense of academic control overcome obstacles and focus on learning, thereby reducing the probability of smartphone addiction behaviors and indirectly regulating academic anxiety.

Furthermore, when college students who are addicted to mobile phones enter the society, they may restrain their addictive behaviors in order to make a living or reduce their addictive behaviors through educational interventions at school. If the problem of mobile phone addiction is not improved, it may cause some harm to Chinese society. For example, frequent use of mobile phones by drivers in driving cars will lead to traffic safety problems. In the future, we will further explore and verify the opportunity.

Implications

At a theoretical level, this study enriches our understanding of the impact of smartphone addiction on the academic achievement of college students. By examining the influence of academic anxiety on these two factors, as well as considering the role of academic control, it offers a fresh perspective for future research and contributes to the expansion of theoretical frameworks related to smartphone addiction.

On a practical level, this study provides empirical support for educational and psychological interventions for college students. Educators should pay close attention to students’ academic anxiety and take effective measures to reduce it, which in turn can help mitigate the risks associated with smartphone addiction. Additionally, promoting stronger connections with friends and family can be beneficial in alleviating anxiety.

Limitations and Future Directions

This study has certain limitations. Firstly, it relies on cross-sectional data, which may limit the ability to establish causal relationships. Future research should consider longitudinal study designs for more robust conclusions. Secondly, the study’s participants were solely from one university, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Subsequent studies could expand the sample size and consider the moderating effects of demographic variables for a more in-depth analysis. Finally, the reasons affecting college students’ academic achievement are complex and diverse. This study only selected three factors: smartphone addiction, sense of academic control and academic anxiety for analysis. At the same time, this study only selected academic anxiety as the mediating variable and the sense of academic control as the moderating variable, and whether academic anxiety is the only mediating variable, whether the sense of academic control is the only moderating variable, and whether there are other mediating and moderating variables, these questions still need to be discussed in the next step.

Conclusion

In summary, this study reveals that smartphone addiction among college students negatively predicts academic achievement. Academic anxiety acts as a complete mediator in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement. Moreover, students’ sense of academic control significantly moderates the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety, further influencing the overall mediating effect of academic anxiety. Specifically, smartphone addiction impacts academic achievement through academic anxiety, and this effect is moderated by the degree of academic control.

Smartphones have become essential tools for college students to access information, engage in games, entertainment, and social activities. However, while smartphones bring convenience, they also give rise to new psychosocial problems, such as smartphone addiction and other problematic smartphone usage behaviors.1 While previous research has explored the antecedents of smartphone addiction behavior among college students,2,3 and its relationship with depression and anxiety,4,5 few studies have delved into the mechanism by which smartphone addiction affects academic achievement in college students, considering the factors of academic control and academic anxiety. For example, research by Qin et al showed that negative emotions such as anxiety and stress could predict smartphone addiction among college students, but the results also showed that there was no significant relationship between academic achievement and smartphone addiction.6 The findings of Amez et al show that for each additional unit of smartphone use, the test score decreases by a corresponding value, and the proportion of people who pass the test also decreases.7 Therefore, the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement of college students needs to be further studied. The Compensatory Internet Use Theory suggests that individuals may resort to excessive smartphone usage as a coping mechanism to alleviate negative emotions when faced with adverse life situations, effectively using smartphones as a means of escaping from real-life challenges.8 When college students encounter difficulties in their academic lives, such as academic pressure or interpersonal issues, they may develop a dependence on smartphones, increasing the likelihood of smartphone addiction. Research has shown that negative emotions and other factors may contribute to a heightened tendency towards smartphone addiction.9 College students often experience intense emotions during their learning processes,10 which can directly impact their behavior, learning outcomes, and personal growth. Therefore, it is plausible that academic anxiety negatively predicts academic achievement, providing a theoretical basis for investigating the relationship between smartphone addiction, academic anxiety, and academic achievement.\n\nThe Control-Value Theory places learners’ emotional factors at its core, positing that academic emotions are influenced by the learning environment and value evaluation factors. These emotions significantly impact academic achievements.11 Value evaluation factors encompass a learner’s level of control over the learning process and the value they place on learning activities and objectives. Mastery goal orientation, an important component of value evaluation, reflects a learner’s pursuit of self-improvement and knowledge mastery during the learning process. Academic affective factors encompass emotions directly related to a learner’s learning, classroom teaching, and academic achievement.12 This theory offers a multifaceted perspective on the relationship between the learning environment, value evaluation, emotional factors, and academic achievement. It aids in comprehensively and profoundly understanding the causes of learners’ psychological factors and their impact on academic achievements, providing a foundation for exploring the mechanisms linking the learning environment, academic control, academic emotions, and academic achievements. Given the potential significance of smartphone addiction on academic achievement, this study aims to explore the relationship between college students’ smartphone addiction, academic anxiety, academic control, and academic achievement.\n\nBased on control-value theory and compensatory network use theory, this study constructs a conceptual model (see Figure 1), which examines the “how” and “when” of college students’ smartphone addiction affect college students’ academic achievement, with three main objectives:(1) to examine the correlation between smartphone addiction and academic achievement among college students; (2) to examine whether academic anxiety plays a mediating role between college students’ smartphone addiction and academic achievement; (3) to explore whether the sense of academic control can regulate the mediating first half of college students’ smartphone addiction and academic anxiety.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nConceptual model.\n\nHypothesis\nCollege Students’ Smartphone Addiction and Academic Achievement\n\nThe term “smartphone addiction” initially emerged in research related to driving safety. As smartphones became increasingly ubiquitous and their impact on individuals grew, the concept of problematic smartphone use, akin to addictive behaviors such as gambling, gaming, shopping, and internet usage, gained attention among researchers.13 Scholars like Bianchi and others propose that excessive smartphone usage is the central characteristic of smartphone addiction, with individuals becoming obsessed with smartphones due to various motivations.2 According to Chóliz, specific features of smartphone addiction include high communication costs due to excessive smartphone use, conflicts with parents arising from smartphone use, interference with other activities such as learning, increasing time spent on smartphones to derive pleasure, and emotional fluctuations when smartphone use is restricted.14\n\nIn light of these definitions, this study defines smartphone addiction as an individual’s inability to control the timing and location of smartphone use, excessive dependence on smartphones, and a range of inappropriate behaviors. These behaviors encompass withdrawal symptoms (negative physiological and psychological reactions when individuals do not use smartphones), heightened preoccupation with smartphones (where individuals prioritize smartphones in their thoughts and activities), increased reliance on smartphones for social interactions, and mood swings linked to smartphone usage.\n\nAcademic achievement plays a vital role in education as it is one of the most important outcomes of the educational process. It serves as the key for students to understand their talents, abilities, and potential.15 Generally, academic achievement is manifested as academic performance in school.\n\nExcessive use of smartphones can negatively impact students’ academic performance. Individuals with high levels of smartphone addiction have a higher probability of procrastination16 and consequently, lower academic performance.17 Students who abstain from using smartphones in class tend to pay more attention to their studies, resulting in higher scores on knowledge tests.18 Smartphone use during study has been associated with lower grade point averages,19 and frequent smartphone use has led to a significant decline in students’ academic performance.20 In daily study and life, if college students cannot effectively resist the temptation of smartphones and indulge in uncontrolled smartphone use, often referred to as smartphone addiction, it may have a detrimental effect on their academic achievements. This paper proposes the following hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis 1: Smartphone addiction in college students has a significant negative correlation with academic achievement.\n\nMediating Role of Academic Anxiety\n\nAcademic anxiety encompasses negative emotions such as restlessness and neuro-emotions (affective components), worry (cognition), avoidance motivation (motivation), anxious facial expressions (expressiveness), and peripheral physiological activation (physiological).21 It encompasses emotions like worry, nervousness, and restlessness related to academic performance in a school environment, including study anxiety, classroom anxiety, and test anxiety.22–24\n\nIn studies examining the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety among college students, it has been found that anxiety and smartphone addiction are significantly positively correlated. Negative emotions can exacerbate problematic smartphone behavior.25,26 Psychological distress, including anxiety, among college students, can lead to excessive smartphone use as a coping mechanism, as individuals may turn to smartphones to alleviate negative emotions.27–29 Conversely, when individuals refrain from using smartphones or have their smartphone usage restricted, they often experience feelings of loss, irritability, restlessness, and anxiety.30 Research by McCann suggests a negative correlation between state anxiety and academic achievement.31 Many studies have shown that anxiety is significantly negatively correlated with academic achievement,32,33 and the interaction between anxiety and physiological anxiety levels in adolescents can affect academic achievement,34 students with reading and math learning difficulties both reported higher levels of anxiety.35 Anxiety, especially in the context of foreign language learning, has been found to be related to poorer language proficiency.36 In a study by Da et al exploring the role of mathematics anxiety in the relationship between smartphone addiction and mathematical achievement, it was discovered that mathematical anxiety mediated between smartphone addiction and mathematical achievement. The intensity of smartphone addiction can regulate mathematical anxiety, and in turn, affect mathematical achievement.37 This paper proposes the following hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis 2: College students’ academic anxiety mediates the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement.\n\nModerating Role of Academic Control\n\nThe term “academic control” was first introduced by Perry in 1991. Academic control refers to a student’s belief in their ability to predict and influence their academic performance. It is an individual’s perception of their capacity to control and forecast academic outcomes to a certain extent.38,39 Sense of academic control for college students entails feelings and perceptions of their ability to influence academic outcomes, a belief in their capability to achieve academic goals, and the conviction that academic success depends on factors they can control. Additionally, it involves recognizing the factors that contribute to academic success and experiencing a sense of gradual progress toward goals through hard work. This fosters a sense of personal strength and value.40\n\nData from Respondek et al suggests that students who use smartphones for more than 7 hours per week tend to pay less attention to their academic abilities. Excessive smartphone usage can have a detrimental effect on students’ sense of academic control. Consequently, students with low academic control may predict higher levels of anxiety,41 whereas students with a high sense of academic control tend to experience lower levels of academic anxiety and are more likely to allocate more time to learning and less time to smartphone use. Research by Kang et al shows that anxiety plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between a sense of academic control and self-regulated learning.42 Students with a strong sense of academic control experience lower stress,43 and anxiety-induced increased arousal, such as distraction, can adversely affect cognitive executive control.44 Sense of academic control is positively associated with positive emotions such as enjoyment and is negatively correlated with negative emotions like anxiety.45 Sense of academic control is especially important for college students to adapt to the learning environment and overcome stress.46,47\n\nBuilding on the above hypotheses, our study further infers that there may be a moderating effect on the mediating role of college students’ sense of academic control in academic anxiety between smartphone addiction and academic achievement. In other words, when college students have a higher level of academic control, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement through academic anxiety is correspondingly weaker. Conversely, when the level of academic control is lower, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction through academic anxiety on academic achievement is stronger. Therefore, the hypothesis is put forward:\n\nHypothesis 3: College students’ sense of academic control moderates the mediating effect of academic anxiety. In essence, a higher level of academic control weakens the mediating effect, while a lower level of academic control strengthens it.\n\nResearch Methods\nParticipants and Procedure\n\nThe study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethical Committee of Liaoning Normal University and all participants provided informed consent. Participants were selected with cluster sampling method with the school as a sampling unit from 20 schools in Liaoning Normal University. The cluster sampling method is used to obtain the data information of a group more comprehensively, which is easy to organize and implement, and can save manpower and material resources. This study involved undergraduates from Liaoning Normal University, including students from the Department of Education, the School of Government Management, the School of Psychology, the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, the School of Mathematics, the School of Foreign Chinese, the School of Fine Arts, and so on. A total of 2097 questionnaires were distributed using purposive sampling and the college-student duality method. After eliminating 41 invalid questionnaires with missing or inconsistent answers, we obtained 2056 (98.04%) valid responses. Of the participants, 407 (19.8%) were male, and 1649 (80.2%) were female. Additionally, 1210 (58.9%) were enrolled in humanities and social sciences, while 846 (41.1%) were in science, engineering, and medicine. Moreover, 849 (41.3%) were registered in rural areas, and 1207 (58.7%) were registered in urban areas.\n\nMeasures\nSmartphone Addiction\n\nWe used the “College Students’ Smartphone Addiction Tendency Scale” developed by Xiong Jie, Zhou Zongkui, Chen Wu, You Zhiqi, and Zhai Ziyan in 2012.48 The scale has a total of 16 items encompassing four dimensions, which are withdrawal symptom, conspicuous behavior, social comfort and mood change., items such as “I feel more fulfilled in my life with more phone calls and text messages” and “I feel lonely without a smartphone.” Participants rated these statements on a scale of 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“very conform”). Higher total scores indicate more intense feelings of smartphone addiction. The internal consistency confidence of the scale in this study was α=0.94.\n\nAcademic Anxiety\n\nWe employed the Academic Anxiety Scale from the Achievement Emotional Questionnaire (AEQ) as developed by Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, and Perry in 2002.49 This scale originally contained 39 items, but after the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis after of the initial test data recovery, we retained 21 items with a total of three dimensions, which are classroom anxiety, learning anxiety and test anxiety, items such as “Sitting in class, I feel uneasy” and “I am nervous in class”. Participants rated their responses on a scale of 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“very conform”). Higher total scores indicate more intense feelings of academic anxiety. The internal consistency confidence of the scale in this study was α=0.98. The structural validity of the scale was assessed, resulting in X2/df=4.82, GFI=0.974, NFI=0.981, IFI=0.985, CFI=0.985, and RMSEA=0.043 as fitting indices.\n\nSense of Academic Control\n\nWe used the revised Academic Control Scale developed by Perry, Hladkyj, Pekrun, and Pelletier in 2001 and adapted by Ju Yachan in 2012.50,51 The scale originally contained 8 items, but we retained 6 items after initial testing to suit our research context. With a total of two dimensions, which are internal action control and external environment control, items statements include “I think I have a great degree of control over my academic performance” and “The more effort I put into my studies, the better my academic performance will be”. Participants rated these statements on a scale of 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“very conform”). The reverse scoring questions are 4, 5, and 6. Higher total scores indicate less intense feelings of external environment control. The internal consistency confidence of the scale in this study was α=0.72.\n\nAcademic Achievement\n\nAcademic achievement was measured based on university students’ achievement points, which were weighted in the analysis.\n\nResults\nCommon Method Variance\n\nWe conducted the Harman univariate test, as recommended by Jakobsen and Jensen, to assess the extent of common method bias in the data. The results indicated that there were seven characteristic factors with values greater than 1. However, the first factor explained only 37.46% of the variation, which did not exceed the 40% threshold suggested by Jakobsen and Jensen. Therefore, we concluded that there was no serious common method bias in this study.52\n\nDescriptive Statistical Analysis of Each Variable\n\nTable 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients for each study variable. The results reveal that the statistically significant negative correlation between smartphone addiction and academic achievement is very low (r= −0.05 p<0.05). Furthermore, smartphone addiction is significantly positively correlated with academic anxiety (r=0.61, p<0.01), while academic anxiety is significantly negatively correlated with academic achievement (r=−0.11, p<0.01). Additionally, sense of academic control is significantly positively correlated with academic achievement (r=0.24, p<0.01). As a result, hypothesis 1 has been preliminarily verified, providing a solid foundation for subsequent hierarchical regression analysis.\n\nTable 1.\n\nMeans, Standard Deviation, and Correlation Coefficients for Variable Scores\n\nVariable\tM\tSD\t1\t2\t3\t4\n1.Smartphone addiction\t2.86\t0.72\t1\t\t\t\n2.Academic anxiety\t2.43\t0.77\t0.61**\t1\t\t\n3.Sense of academic control\t3.59\t0.53\t−0.23**\t−0.47**\t1\t\n4.Academic achievement\t3.23\t0.52\t−0.05*\t−0.11**\t0.24**\t1\nOpen in a new tab\n\nNote: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, the same below.\n\nTesting of Research Hypotheses\n\nFirstly, hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the simple and direct impact of smartphone addiction on academic achievement among college students. The data revealed that, after controlling for demographic variables (gender, major, domicile place, annual household economic income, monthly disposable income in school, parenting style and graduation plan), smartphone addiction among college students had a significant negative effect on academic achievement (b=−0.05, p<0.05), confirming the verification of hypothesis 1.\n\nSecondly, we employed the SPSS macro program PROCESS, developed by Hayes, to analyze the simple mediating effect of academic anxiety on the relationship between college students’ smartphone addiction and academic achievement (as shown in Table 2). The analysis results indicated that, after accounting for demographic variables (gender, major, domicile place, annual household economic income, monthly disposable income in school, parenting style and graduation plan), smartphone addiction among college students had a significant positive effect on academic anxiety (M1, b=0.65, p<0.01). Furthermore, when smartphone addiction and academic anxiety were simultaneously included in the regression model, the results demonstrated that academic anxiety significantly influenced academic achievement (M2, b=−0.1, p<0.01). Additionally, the nonparametric percentile Bootstrap method, corrected for bias, was employed to assess the mediating effect of academic anxiety. The results indicated that the mediating effect of academic anxiety was significant in the pathway from college students’ smartphone addiction to academic achievement, with an indirect effect value of −0.067 (p<0.01) and a 95% confidence interval of Boot (−0.069, −0.018). The confidence interval did not include zero, confirming the significance of the pure mediating effect of academic anxiety and thus verifying hypothesis 2.\n\nTable 2.\n\nMediating Effect Analysis of Academic Anxiety\n\nVariable\tAcademic Anxiety (M1)\tAcademic Achievement (M2)\nb\tSE\tt\tb\tSE\tt\nGender\t−0.10**\t0.03\t−2.85\t0.19***\t0.03\t6.16\nMajor\t0.06*\t0.03\t2.07\t−0.10***\t0.02\t−4.21\nDomicile Place\t0.02\t0.03\t0.66\t0.01\t0.02\t−0.47\nAnnual household economic income\t−0.02\t0.02\t−0.87\t−0.01\t0.02\t−0.66\nMonthly disposable income in school\t−0.08**\t0.03\t−2.66\t0.05\t0.02\t1.89\nParenting style\t0.00\t0.02\t0.06\t−0.03\t0.01\t−1.90\nGraduation plan\t0.07***\t0.02\t4.16\t−0.06***\t0.02\t−4.03\nSmartphone addiction\t0.65***\t0.02\t34.94\t0.05\t0.02\t0.27\nAcademic anxiety\t\t\t\t−0.07***\t0.02\t−3.63\nR2\t0.39\t\t\t0.06\t\t\nF\t161.22***\t\t\t14.29***\t\t\nOpen in a new tab\n\nNotes: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, the same below.

The analysis outcomes indicated that the interaction effect between smartphone addiction and the level of academic control in the regression model achieved statistical significance (M3, b=−0.28, p<0.01). In other words, the interaction between smartphone addiction and academic control significantly influenced the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety.\n\nTable 3.\n\nAnalysis of Mediating Effects with Regulation\n\nVariable\tAcademic Anxiety (M3)\tAcademic Achievement (M4)\nb\tSE\tt\tb\tSE\tt\nGender\t−0.04\t0.03\t−1.30\t0.19***\t0.03\t6.16\nMajor\t0.02\t0.03\t0.86\t−0.10***\t0.02\t−4.21\nDomicile place\t0.03\t0.03\t1.09\t0.01\t0.02\t−0.47\nAnnual household economic income\t−0.01\t0.02\t−0.17\t−0.01\t0.02\t−0.66\nMonthly disposable income in school\t−0.07**\t0.03\t−2.69\t0.05\t0.02\t1.89\nParenting style\t0.02\t0.02\t−1.15\t−0.03\t0.01\t−1.90\nGraduation plan\t0.02\t0.02\t1.47\t−0.06***\t0.02\t−4.03\nSmartphone addiction\t0.55***\t0.02\t31.53\t0.05\t0.02\t0.27\nAcademic anxiety\t\t\t\t−0.07***\t0.02\t−3.63\nSense of academic control\t−0.51***\t0.02\t−21.66\t\t\t\nSmartphone addiction× Sense of academic control\t−0.28***\t0.03\t−10.21\t\t\t\nR2\t0.51\t\t\t0.06\t\t\nF\t214.25***\t\t\t14.29***\t\t\nOpen in a new tab\n\nNote: **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, the same below.\n\nTo provide a more intuitive representation of the moderating effect in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety, the researchers created a simple slope diagram illustrating the regulatory impact (refer to Figure 2). As depicted, when college students possess a strong sense of academic control, the positive association between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety is attenuated. Conversely, when college students exhibit a weak sense of academic control, the positive relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety becomes more pronounced. This observation validates hypothesis 3.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nModerating effect of the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety.\n\nTo further investigate the moderating effect of the sense of academic control on the mediating influence of academic anxiety, a detailed analysis was conducted (refer to Table 4). The outcomes indicated that when college students possessed a strong sense of academic control, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement through academic anxiety was diminished (ρ=0.40, Boot 95% CI does not include 0). Conversely, when college students exhibited a weak sense of academic control, the indirect effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement through academic anxiety remained low (ρ=0.69, Boot 95% CI does not include 0).Following the moderated mediation effect analysis method proposed by Hayes (2015), the parameter Index was tested, resulting in a value of 0.02 with a Boot 95% confidence interval of (0.01, 0.03), which does not contain 0. In summary, these findings demonstrate that the mediating effect of academic anxiety in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement is subject to regulation by the sense of academic control, confirming the empirical support for hypothesis 3.\n\nTable 4.\n\nConditional Indirect Effects Analysis\n\nA Sense of Academic Control\tEffect\tBootSE\tBootLLCI\tBootULCI\nLow sense of academic control\t0.69\t0.02\t0.65\t0.74\nMiddle sense of academic control\t0.55\t0.02\t0.51\t0.58\nHigh sense of academic control\t0.40\t0.02\t0.35\t0.45\nSmartphone addiction × Sense of academic control\t−0.28\t0.03\t−0.33\t−0.22\nOpen in a new tab\nDiscussion\nDirect Effect of College Students’ Smartphone Addiction and Academic Achievement\n\nIt is evident that smartphone addiction among college students has a detrimental effect on their academic achievement. This aligns with numerous prior studies supporting this notion. For instance, as supported by 36 reviewed studies,53 smartphone use was negatively correlated with students’ academic performance. Samaha and Hawi noted that individuals with high levels of smartphone addiction tended to achieve lower academic outcomes.17 This conclusion is in line with the media dependence theory,54 suggesting that the more individuals rely on media, such as smartphones, to meet their needs, the greater the impact of media on them. At the same time, in line with this conclusion, the uncontrolled use of smartphones leads to a series of physical and mental problems in students, as well as reduced academic achievement.55 Moreover, his study reaffirms the negative effect of smartphone addiction on academic achievement among college students. Smartphone addiction consumes substantial time originally designated for learning activities, consequently jeopardizing the quality of task completion. Additionally, students may develop an excessive psychological dependence on smartphones, seeking solace and understanding, which detracts from their academic pursuits. Therefore, it is imperative to guide students in adopting a balanced approach to smartphone usage to mitigate the prevalence of smartphone addiction.\n\nThe reason for the low negative correlation coefficient between smartphone addiction and academic performance may be that college students use mobile phones for studying, and students spend a lot of time using smartphones to acquire knowledge and improve their academic performance, but they cannot reasonably control the use time, resulting in smartphone addiction.\n\nMediating Role of Academic Anxiety\n\nAcademic anxiety among college students plays a pivotal mediating role in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement. Smartphone addiction not only directly affects students’ academic performance but also indirectly influences academic achievement by exacerbating academic anxiety. This perspective, grounded in academic emotions, enhances our understanding of the connection between smartphone addiction and academic achievement, better reflecting the real academic experiences of students. This conclusion aligns with previous findings,56 which suggest that anxiety can drive individuals to use smartphones excessively as a coping mechanism, thereby predicting smartphone addiction.36,57 Students developed learning anxiety in foreign language classrooms, and the higher the level of anxiety themselves, the lower the foreign language proficiency.37 Furthermore, it is consistent with control-value theory.11 This research highlights that negative academic emotions like academic anxiety can significantly impact students’ academic achievement, broadening our perspective on the relationship between academic anxiety and academic performance.\n\nModerating Role of Sense of Academic Control\n\nThe study found that college students’ sense of academic control significantly moderates the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety. Additionally, this sense of academic control also moderates the overall mediating effect of academic anxiety. These findings have important implications for educational psychologists and researchers. It suggests that strategies or interventions aimed at enhancing students’ sense of academic control can potentially reduce academic anxiety, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of smartphone addiction on academic achievement. Students with a strong sense of academic control are more likely to allocate more time to their studies, resulting in lower anxiety levels.58 In line with this, students who exhibit good self-control are less susceptible to smartphone addiction.59 Students who use smartphones for more than 7 hours per week will pay less attention to ability in the curriculum, and excessive use of smartphones will have a harmful effect on students’ sense of academic control, that is, smartphone addiction will lead to a decrease in academic control. A good sense of self-control moderated the relationship between personal growth initiative and the risk of smartphone addiction, thereby reducing the risk of smartphone addiction; this is also consistent with the results of the study of 571 college students: smartphone addiction has a negative impact on individual self-control and further leads to poor academic performance;60 Embodies the idea of Compensatory Internet Use Theory,61 students gain comfort and understanding in the Internet by using smartphones to escape negative emotions such as academic anxiety during academic activities; while control-value theory, students with the high sense of academic control overcome obstacles and focus on learning, thereby reducing the probability of smartphone addiction behaviors and indirectly regulating academic anxiety.\n\nFurthermore, when college students who are addicted to mobile phones enter the society, they may restrain their addictive behaviors in order to make a living or reduce their addictive behaviors through educational interventions at school. If the problem of mobile phone addiction is not improved, it may cause some harm to Chinese society. For example, frequent use of mobile phones by drivers in driving cars will lead to traffic safety problems. In the future, we will further explore and verify the opportunity.\n\nImplications\n\nAt a theoretical level, this study enriches our understanding of the impact of smartphone addiction on the academic achievement of college students. By examining the influence of academic anxiety on these two factors, as well as considering the role of academic control, it offers a fresh perspective for future research and contributes to the expansion of theoretical frameworks related to smartphone addiction.\n\nOn a practical level, this study provides empirical support for educational and psychological interventions for college students. Educators should pay close attention to students’ academic anxiety and take effective measures to reduce it, which in turn can help mitigate the risks associated with smartphone addiction. Additionally, promoting stronger connections with friends and family can be beneficial in alleviating anxiety.\n\nLimitations and Future Directions\n\nThis study has certain limitations. Firstly, it relies on cross-sectional data, which may limit the ability to establish causal relationships. Future research should consider longitudinal study designs for more robust conclusions. Secondly, the study’s participants were solely from one university, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Subsequent studies could expand the sample size and consider the moderating effects of demographic variables for a more in-depth analysis. Finally, the reasons affecting college students’ academic achievement are complex and diverse. This study only selected three factors: smartphone addiction, sense of academic control and academic anxiety for analysis. At the same time, this study only selected academic anxiety as the mediating variable and the sense of academic control as the moderating variable, and whether academic anxiety is the only mediating variable, whether the sense of academic control is the only moderating variable, and whether there are other mediating and moderating variables, these questions still need to be discussed in the next step.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, this study reveals that smartphone addiction among college students negatively predicts academic achievement. Academic anxiety acts as a complete mediator in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement. Moreover, students’ sense of academic control significantly moderates the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety, further influencing the overall mediating effect of academic anxiety. Specifically, smartphone addiction impacts academic achievement through academic anxiety, and this effect is moderated by the degree of academic control.\n\nFunding Statement\n\nThis work was funded by 2023 Liaoning Normal University High-end Research Achievements Cultivation Funding Program (23GDW001), 2022 Liaoning Provincial Department of Education Category D-Youth Project (LJKQR20222507) and 2023 Liaoning Normal University teacher-guided undergraduate scientific research training project (CX202302007).\n\nData Sharing Statement\n\nAll data included in the current study can be obtained from the corresponding authors through their email address upon reasonable request.\n\nEthics Statement\n\nThe study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Liaoning Normal University, and we have obtained the informed consent from the study participants.

### Report on the Effects of Nighttime Smartphone Use on Sleep Quality Among Teenagers

#### Introduction
The pervasive use of smartphones among adolescents has raised concerns about its impact on sleep quality. This report synthesizes findings from a clinically oriented review published in Cureus, which explores the effects of smartphone usage on sleep patterns and the broader implications for teenagers' health and academic performance.

#### Impact on Sleep Quality
1. **Circadian Rhythm Disruption**: Smartphones emit blue light, which is known to suppress melatonin secretion, a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles. This suppression can lead to delayed sleep onset and disrupted circadian rhythms, resulting in poor sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency.

2. **Sleep Displacement**: The unstructured nature of smartphone use, particularly at night, can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use lacks a clear endpoint, which can extend usage time and encroach on sleep duration.

3. **Content-Induced Arousal**: The type of content consumed on smartphones, such as stimulating games or videos, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset. This heightened state of arousal can further degrade sleep quality and contribute to daytime sleepiness.

4. **Short Sleep Duration**: Studies have consistently shown that increased smartphone use is associated with shorter sleep duration. This is particularly concerning for adolescents, who require adequate sleep for cognitive and physical development.

5. **Bidirectional Relationship**: There is evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship between smartphone use and sleep disturbances. While smartphone use can lead to poor sleep, existing sleep issues may also drive increased smartphone use as a coping mechanism.

#### Consequences for Adolescents
1. **Academic Performance**: Sleep is critical for memory consolidation and learning. Disrupted sleep patterns due to smartphone use can impair academic performance, as sleep deprivation affects attention, focus, and cognitive processing.

2. **Mental Health**: Chronic sleep deprivation linked to smartphone use can exacerbate mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these effects due to ongoing developmental changes.

3. **Physical Health**: Beyond mental health, poor sleep quality can have broader health implications, including increased risk for metabolic disorders and weakened immune function.

#### Recommendations
1. **Screen Time Guidelines**: Health organizations recommend limiting screen time for adolescents to no more than two hours per day to mitigate the negative effects on sleep and overall health.

2. **Pre-Bedtime Restrictions**: Encouraging adolescents to avoid smartphone use at least 30 minutes before bedtime can improve sleep quality and duration.

### Report on the Effects of Nighttime Smartphone Use on Sleep Quality Among Teenagers

#### Introduction
The systematic literature review titled "The Influence of Smartphones on Adolescent Sleep" provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of smartphone use on the sleep quality of teenagers. The study, conducted by Sofia de Sá and colleagues, aims to understand how the use of smartphones affects adolescent sleep patterns, quality, and overall well-being.

#### Background
Sleep is a critical component of adolescent health, contributing to physical and psychological recovery. The circadian rhythm in adolescents is naturally delayed, leading to later sleep onset and wake times. The National Sleep Foundation recommends 8 to 10 hours of sleep for adolescents, emphasizing that quality is as important as quantity.

#### Methodology
The review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and utilized databases such as CINAHL Complete and Medline. The PICO method was employed to frame the research question: "Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?" The review included randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and observational studies published between 2014 and 2022.

#### Key Findings
1. **Negative Impact on Sleep Quality and Quantity**: The review found a consistent negative relationship between smartphone use and sleep quality and quantity among adolescents. Nighttime smartphone use is linked to insufficient sleep and mental health issues.

2. **Prevalence of Technology Use**: A significant percentage of adolescents use technology before bedtime, with 97% using some form of technology and 74% specifically using mobile phones. This usage is associated with waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness.

3. **Smartphone Ownership and Sleep Problems**: Adolescents who own smartphones are more likely to experience sleep problems compared to non-owners. The acquisition of a smartphone often leads to reduced sleep duration and increased sleep disturbances.

4. **Psychosocial and Behavioral Effects**: Nighttime smartphone use is correlated with depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and poor coping abilities. It also affects academic performance and overall daytime functioning.

5. **Role of Nurses and Educators**: The study highlights the role of nurses and educators in promoting healthy sleep habits and educating adolescents and their families about the risks of excessive nighttime technology use.

#### Discussion
The review underscores the urgent need to address the impact of smartphone use on adolescent sleep. The cognitive and emotional stimulation from social interactions and gaming, coupled with screen light exposure, disrupts melatonin production and sleep onset. The findings suggest that interventions are needed to promote healthy technology use, particularly at night.

#### Conclusions
The systematic review provides strong evidence that nighttime smartphone use adversely affects adolescent sleep quality and duration. It calls for measures to encourage responsible technology use and highlights the importance of educating adolescents and their caregivers about the potential health risks.

#### Limitations and Future Research
The review notes limitations in the age range of study participants and reliance on self-reported data. Future research should explore the relationship between screen time and sleep more comprehensively, considering factors such as device type and usage patterns.

#### Recommendations
- **Educational Interventions**: Implement educational programs for adolescents and parents about the importance of sleep hygiene and the risks of nighttime smartphone use.
- **Policy Development**: Develop policies to limit nighttime technology use among adolescents to promote better sleep quality.
- **Further Research**: Conduct longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term effects of smartphone use on adolescent sleep and well-being.

This report highlights the critical need for awareness and intervention strategies to mitigate the negative effects of smartphone use on adolescent sleep.

The provided text is a comprehensive study on the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement, specifically focusing on college students. While the study does not directly address teenagers, it provides valuable insights into the broader topic of smartphone addiction and academic performance, which can be extrapolated to younger populations, including teenagers.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Negative Correlation with Academic Achievement**: The study found a significant negative correlation between smartphone addiction and academic achievement among college students. This suggests that higher levels of smartphone addiction are associated with lower academic performance.

2. **Role of Academic Anxiety**: Academic anxiety was identified as a complete mediator in the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic achievement. This means that smartphone addiction can lead to increased academic anxiety, which in turn negatively impacts academic performance.

3. **Moderating Role of Academic Control**: The sense of academic control was found to moderate the relationship between smartphone addiction and academic anxiety. Students with a higher sense of academic control experienced a weaker impact of smartphone addiction on academic anxiety, thereby reducing its negative effect on academic achievement.

4. **Implications for Education**: The study suggests that interventions aimed at reducing academic anxiety and enhancing students' sense of academic control could mitigate the negative effects of smartphone addiction on academic performance.

5. **Theoretical Contributions**: The research enriches the understanding of how smartphone addiction affects academic achievement by incorporating the roles of academic anxiety and control, providing a new perspective for future research.

6. **Practical Applications**: Educators are encouraged to focus on reducing academic anxiety and promoting a strong sense of academic control among students to help manage smartphone addiction and improve academic outcomes.

### Limitations and Future Directions:

- The study is based on cross-sectional data, which limits the ability to establish causal relationships.
- The sample was limited to one university, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.
- Future research could explore additional mediating and moderating variables and consider longitudinal study designs for more robust conclusions.

### Conclusion:

While the study focuses on college students, the findings highlight the potential negative impact of smartphone addiction on academic performance, mediated by academic anxiety and moderated by academic control. These insights can be relevant for understanding similar dynamics in teenagers, suggesting that managing smartphone use and addressing academic anxiety could be crucial for improving academic outcomes in younger populations.

This report synthesizes findings from a clinically oriented review published in Cureus, which explores the effects of smartphone usage on sleep patterns and the broader implications for teenagers\' health and academic performance.\n\n#### Impact on Sleep Quality\n1. **Circadian Rhythm Disruption**: Smartphones emit blue light, which is known to suppress melatonin secretion, a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles. This suppression can lead to delayed sleep onset and disrupted circadian rhythms, resulting in poor sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency.\n\n2. **Sleep Displacement**: The unstructured nature of smartphone use, particularly at night, can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use lacks a clear endpoint, which can extend usage time and encroach on sleep duration.\n\n3. **Content-Induced Arousal**: The type of content consumed on smartphones, such as stimulating games or videos, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset. This heightened state of arousal can further degrade sleep quality and contribute to daytime sleepiness.\n\n4. **Short Sleep Duration**: Studies have consistently shown that increased smartphone use is associated with shorter sleep duration. This is particularly concerning for adolescents, who require adequate sleep for cognitive and physical development.\n\n5. **Bidirectional Relationship**: There is evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship between smartphone use and sleep disturbances. While smartphone use can lead to poor sleep, existing sleep issues may also drive increased smartphone use as a coping mechanism.\n\n#### Consequences for Adolescents\n1. **Academic Performance**: Sleep is critical for memory consolidation and learning. Disrupted sleep patterns due to smartphone use can impair academic performance, as sleep deprivation affects attention, focus, and cognitive processing.\n\n2. **Mental Health**: Chronic sleep deprivation linked to smartphone use can exacerbate mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these effects due to ongoing developmental changes.\n\n3. **Physical Health**: Beyond mental health, poor sleep quality can have broader health implications, including increased risk for metabolic disorders and weakened immune function.\n\n#### Recommendations\n1. **Screen Time Guidelines**: Health organizations recommend limiting screen time for adolescents to no more than two hours per day to mitigate the negative effects on sleep and overall health.\n\n2. **Pre-Bedtime Restrictions**: Encouraging adolescents to avoid smartphone use at least 30 minutes before bedtime can improve sleep quality and duration.\n\n3. **Education and Counseling**: Raising awareness about the impact of smartphone use on sleep and providing counseling to adolescents can help promote healthier usage patterns and improve sleep hygiene.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe review underscores the significant impact of nighttime smartphone use on sleep quality among teenagers.

Abstract

(1) Background: Sleep is considered to be a complex condition for human beings, with the aim of ensuring physical and psychological recovery. Technology, including the cell phone, is a tool for teenagers that ensures they are always available to interact, even at night. This study aims to understand the influence of the use of smartphones on adolescent sleep quality. (2) Methods: The guidelines proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed. The search was conducted in October 2022 through the EBSCOhost platform, with access to the CINAHL Complete and Medline databases and through the b-On database. (3) Results: The use of electronic equipment plays an important role in adolescents’ lives. There is a negative relationship between the use of electronic equipment, such as smartphones, and sleep, for reducing both the quality and quantity of sleep. There is also a relationship between nighttime smartphone use, insufficient sleep, and mental health problems. (4) Conclusions: The use of new technologies at night causes a change in the behavior of adolescents with repercussions in terms of the quality of sleep and sleep duration and consequent well-being and performance during the day.

Keywords: smartphone, children, well-being, sleep, teenagers, media

1. Introduction

Sleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].

In a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).

The circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].

As it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.

The World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.

For good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.

Nowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].

This permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).

The Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.

Considering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.

2. Materials and Methods

A Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).

Using the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”

The search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.

The articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.

Among the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.

All articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.

Regarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.

All studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.

The analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].

Johansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.

In fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

4. Discussion

Adolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].

Technological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].

Schweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

The constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.

If, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.

The high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.

In fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.

The studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.

Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.

According to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].

Many authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.

In Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).

Meeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).

This study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.

Therefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.

Nursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).

Johansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].

In this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].

It is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.

5. Conclusions

It was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.

The influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.

It becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.

Based on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.

6. Limitations/Future Prospects

Limitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.

Introduction\n\nSleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].\n\nIn a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).\n\nThe circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].\n\nAs it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.\n\nThe World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.\n\nFor good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.\n\nNowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].\n\nThis permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).\n\nThe Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.\n\nConsidering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nA Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).\n\nUsing the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”\n\nThe search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.\n\nThe articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.\n\nAmong the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nPRISMA of study selection and inclusion process [10].\n\nAfter the selection of studies, they were evaluated critically by applying assessment grids of the level of evidence, reliability, and relevance, which allowed us to classify the studies found (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.\n\nCritical evaluation of the results of the included studies according to the critical evaluation verification list by Joanna Briggs Institute [11].\n\nArticles\tQ1\tQ2\tQ3\tQ4\tQ5\tQ6\tQ7\tQ8\tQ9\tQ10\tResult\nTavernier et al.

One month after, the students were visited a second time and completed the same questionnaire.\nOpen in a new tab\n\nAll articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.\n\nRegarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.\n\nAll studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.\n\nThe analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].\n\nJohansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.\n\nIn fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nLikewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAdolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].\n\nTechnological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].\n\nSchweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nThe constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.\n\nIf, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.\n\nThe high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.\n\nIn fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.\n\nThe studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.\n\nLike these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.\n\nAccording to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].\n\nMany authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.\n\nIn Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).\n\nMeeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).\n\nThis study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.\n\nTherefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.\n\nNursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).\n\nJohansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].\n\nIn this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].\n\nIt is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIt was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.\n\nThe influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.\n\nIt becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.\n\nBased on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.\n\n6. Limitations/Future Prospects\n\nLimitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.d.C.M. and M.C.; methodology, S.d.S., A.B. and M.C.; software, M.J.R. and H.M.; validation, H.M., S.D. and M.J.R.; formal analysis, S.d.S.; investigation, M.J.R. and S.D.; resources, S.d.S. and A.B.; data curation, M.d.C.M.; writing—original draft preparation, S.d.S. and A.B.; writing—review and editing, M.J.R.; visualization, S.D.; supervision, M.C.; project administration, S.d.S. and M.d.C.M.

Abstract

Smartphones are an integral part of our lives due to benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment including games. The many benefits of a smartphone, like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are however balanced by negative health consequences. Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Sleep plays a crucial role in memory and is essential for all stages of learning. Restorative sleep may also prepare the brain for new learning. The use of smartphones could disrupt lifestyle, sleep, and potentially, multiple cellular processes through their impact on circadian rhythms and lead to significant and widespread morbidity and mortality. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. These findings must be seen against the background of widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone use and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance. The implications of circadian disruption for learning populations, such as university students and professionals training for careers in medicine, and other critical occupations, cannot be overstated. This review highlights the possible negative consequences of smartphone use on overall sleep health while emphasizing the importance of studying its impact, on mental health and learning outcomes, in different populations. The review aimed to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and the consequences for their academic achievement. The method used was a comprehensive search strategy using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases with appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.

Keywords: adolescents, learning, psychiatry & mental health, sleep pattern, smartphone usage

Introduction and background

Mobile phones are mass-produced electronic devices that are an integral part of our lives due to benefits, such as easy accessibility to information, social connectivity, workplace/financial applications, and entertainment, including games. They are popular, especially because they provide these benefits instantly, due to their portability and size [1].

Smartphones, on the other hand, are technologically more advanced mobile devices, which can perform many of the functions of a computer, in addition to those of mobile phones, while having the same convenience and form factor. Given the multifaceted applications of a smartphone, it has also progressively become an intrinsic part of our lives and relationships. 

The many benefits of a smartphone like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are, however, balanced by negative health consequences, including neck pain, accidents, poor mental health, and sleep disturbances [2]. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. A systematic review of Indian adolescents revealed that smartphone addiction among adolescents was 39% to 44% on average. Nearly 300 million of the Indian population uses smartphones [3]. Surveys suggest that up to 50% of teens and 27% of their parents feel that they may be addicted to mobile phones [4].

These negative health consequences are repeatedly highlighted by the popular press. However, it must be kept in mind that many of these negative health consequences of smartphone use are speculative and alarmist. Mental health professionals need to have actionable evidence to counsel their clients in a balanced and appropriate manner based on available scientific evidence [5-6]. 

The objective of this clinically oriented comprehensive review was to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and its consequences on their academic achievement. The methodology used was a comprehensive search strategy in Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases using appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.

Review

Methodology

To conduct this review, a comprehensive search was undertaken using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Keywords include “adolescents”, “psychiatry and mental health”, “learning”, “sleep pattern”, and "smartphone usage”. The search results were supplemented by reviewing the bibliographies of the articles found, ensuring a thorough exploration of the subject matter related to the influence of smartphone usage on sleep patterns, mental health, and the academic performance of adolescents. 

Negative aspects of widespread smartphone use

People using smartphones have problems structuring their daily routines due to the disruptive impact of notifications and screen time. When it comes to students, sleep disturbances may in addition interfere with their ability to reach their classrooms, pay attention, and ability to focus and learn [7]. The result is an inefficient lifestyle with subpar academic outcomes, leading to stress and poor mental health. Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the impact of smartphone use on sleep. First, the bright light emitted suppresses the secretion of melatonin reducing sleep efficiency, delaying sleep onset, and disrupting circadian rhythms [7].

Second, sleep displacement occurs, when the smartphone is used as an unstructured leisure time activity with no predefined beginning and end point, unlike real-world games and other entertainment activities like attending theatrical performances, movies, and arcades [8].

Third, sleep can be affected by the content consumed through the smartphone such as activating music, arousing sexual or violent images, and video games requiring hyper-alertness to anticipate the required responses. Not surprisingly, studies have found that mobile phone usage is associated with short sleep duration, reduced sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. There is also some evidence to suggest that this relationship may be bidirectional, especially in adults where insomnia may be the cause and not the outcome of mobile use [8].

The Millennium Cohort Survey containing 11,553 responses suggested later bedtime and shorter nighttime sleep duration are associated with hyperactivity and inattention. Indeed sleep deprivation was found to exert a modulatory effect on the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation and depression in adolescents [9].

In particular, bedtime smartphone use is predictive of later rising time, longer sleep latency, and worse sleep efficiency. The screen light emitted by mobile phones is of short wavelength and towards the blue length of the light spectrum, which is likely to delay sleep onset for a long duration after exposure. Therefore, screen time guidelines have been evolved for the various age groups specifically affected by smartphone addiction [10]. According to the Australian Department of Health (ADH), the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the recommended screen time for adolescents should not exceed more than two hours per day [11]. 

Biological aspects

In mammals, multiple physiological, endocrine, behavioral, and molecular rhythms are governed by an endogenous clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. It runs freely to a cycle of around 40 minutes and, therefore, needs to be re-synchronized with 24 hours per day. To reset this clock and synchronize it with the solar day, the SCN is entrained daily, by the dark-light cycle to which the organism is exposed [12].

A phase shift in the circadian rhythms of the SCN results in alterations of both the bedtime and wake-up time of an individual which moves to a time earlier in the day (phase advance) or later in the day (phase delay). Light exposure suppresses the melatonin secretion and resets the phase of the SCN, which depends on the timing, intensity, wavelength, duration, and previous exposures to light or darkness. Light exposure, early in the biological night induces a phase delay while exposure late in the night and towards the early morning elicits a phase advance. Notably, these responses are present in blind people also, since the photoreceptors wired for the circadian entrainment are distinct from the rods and the cones of the visual system. These circadian photoreceptors have their peak sensitivity to a light wavelength in the range of 446 to 477 nm (visible short wavelength). Thus, a short wavelength approximately of 460 nm blue light exposure at night evokes a greater phase shift, thus alerting the responses and causing melatonin suppression when compared to other wavelength light in the visual range of 380 to 700 nm. Evidence indicates that these spectrally targeted blue light sources are more efficient in evoking circadian changes such as alertness, faster reaction time, attention lapses, and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while measuring the electrical activity of the brain [12].

Circadian photoreceptors in the retina use melanopsin as photopigment. Along with these receptors, there are specialized ganglion cells that project directly to the SCN. Human circadian rhythms like those of other diurnal species are sensitive to light throughout the biological day. Indeed there is no part of the biological day where light exposure does not affect the circadian rhythms. However, there is a phase delay period in the early biological night and a phase advance region in the late biological night with the transition region occurring late in the biological night. These shifts are evident even with light exposure for a couple of days in a week [12]. 

The human circadian system is sensitive to even low-intensity light especially if it follows many hours of darkness. Most studies show that modern humans get relatively little bright light exposure and spend most of the day in indoor light with an intensity of 200 lux. Such individuals become sensitive to even modest light intensity of 1,000 lux. In addition, even brief flashes of light can be incorporated into the human circadian rhythm if they occur after dark periods. Supplementary to the regular sleep times with darkness during the day, studies have shown that intermittent exposure to bright light throughout the night causes the aligning of the circadian rhythms with the nightshift work schedules [13,14].

The physiological functions of human beings exhibit approximately a 24-hour rhythm. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the molecular mechanism regulating these rhythms. This molecular mechanism comprises genes that increase the transcription of other genes, whose products, in turn, exert a negative feedback, on their gene expression. This autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop is present in every cell of the body. These feedback loops affect many genes that sub-serve the functioning and the timing of cell biology. These individual cellular clocks are kept in synchrony by the neural network that connects them to the central circadian clock of the organism [13,14].

In addition to this genetic mechanism, there have been circadian rhythms noted even in non-nucleated cells such as red blood cells. These non-genetic mechanisms could interact with the gene transcription-translation loops in unknown ways. These mechanisms point to the existence of the primal circadian clock that could be common to all species. The ability of visible light to synchronize with the biological clock of the photosynthetic marine dinoflagellate (Gonyaulax polyedra) has been known since 1958 [13,14].

Human chronobiology

The SCN plays a critical role in regulating photoperiodic behavior and physiology such as sleep, wakefulness, alertness, feeding, hunting/ aggressions, seasonal reproduction, body temperature, and hibernation [15].

A photoreceptive net consisting of the retinal ganglion cells and their axons (containing melanopsin), communicates directly with the brain influencing the circadian rhythms and the pupillary size, through projection to the SCN and the olivary pretectal nuclei, respectively. This photoreceptive system (as opposed to the functionally distinct visual system) encodes and transmits information about the ambient light intensity. Through this system, gross environmental illumination is integrated into the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neural behavioral systems of the human nervous system. Blue light appears to be the strongest synchronizing agent responsible for resetting the circadian rhythm, to keep the biological rhythms and the psycho-behavioral rhythms in phase with the solar day [14]. In humans, bright blue light between 0500 and 1700 hours causes a phase advance, while exposure outside this range results in a phase delay. In humans, the altering effects of blue-enriched light (such as those emitted from phone screens) appear to be stronger in the evenings and during the nighttime compared to the morning hours. Bright, continuous, blue light resets the SCN pacemakers which synchronizes the rhythms of subsidiary cellular clocks which would otherwise run free and go out of phase with each other and out of synchronism with the solar day [15].

Smartphones equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit visible blue light of short wavelength in the range of 446 to 484 nm. This screen light alters the circadian rhythms and also affects the ocular system: it reduces the melatonin hormone secretions (which is controlled by the SCN and the pineal gland) and decreases the core body temperature and the distal-proximal skin temperature (due to vasodilation of the distal blood vessels), leading to an increased level of sleepiness in the mornings and the evenings. Cortisol secretion by the pituitary gland is also influenced by the SCN. Normally there is a rapid increase in the blood cortisol level 30 to 60 minutes after awakening. One hour of exposure to mobile screen light of wavelength (414 to 800 lux) in dim light alters the cortisol awakening response. About 30 minutes of exposure to smartphone screen light with a frequency range of 0.50-3.99 Hz also reduces the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the brain, leading to mental disturbances, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety [16].

These findings have led to the effective use of light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual depression, bulimia, and circadian rhythm disorders related to sleep and dementia [17].

Public health importance

Sleep plays a crucial role in memory symbolization and integration, as noticed by researchers over a century ago. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have revealed several compelling findings. These findings indicate that sleep is essential for all the stages of learning. Sleep provides the ideal environment for neural network-level changes in memory representation and stabilizes the brain for long-term retention. Restorative sleep also prepares the brain for new learning [18]. 

These findings must be seen against the background of the widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone usage and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance [16]. Although no causative links have been shown to date, the International Agency for Research has identified some shift schedules that disrupt the circadian rhythms which serve as a potential carcinogen [19]. Melatonin suppression is also shown to be associated with diabetes mellitus type II [19].

A comparable study conducted in Japan aimed at evaluating the effects of mobile phone usage on sleep in adolescents. The results found that the increased phone use after turning off the lights before bed was linked to shorter sleep duration, poor sleep quality, insomnia, and greater daytime sleepiness [20]. This research highlighted the negative consequences of nighttime phone use on the overall sleep health of adolescents, emphasizing the importance of restricting screen time before sleep.

Multiple recent reviews found that adolescent mental health was significantly impacted by smartphone use. Chronic sleep deprivation leading to reduced cognitive ability/ school performance, social isolation, and self-harm was identified by multiple cross-sectional, longitudinal, and empirical studies in this population [21-23]. Associated comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and excessive alcohol intake were also identified in this population [24,25].

Conclusions

The review was able to flag critical and clinically relevant concerns of public health importance related to the continuous usage of smartphones. Research has proved that the use of smartphones could disrupt circadian rhythms leading to disturbances in lifestyle, sleep, and multiple cellular biological processes.

It is mandatory to impose screen time restrictions and document the levels of impairment related to sleep patterns, negative mood swings, and memory loss produced in the learning population and adolescents. Counseling students about the detrimental consequences of smartphone use before bedtime and the significance of getting sufficient sleep for the achievement of academic success is essential. Some researchers have already found that restriction of mobile phone use for 30 minutes before bedtime has a greater potential for improving sleep, overall mental health, and academic performance of students.

The clinical importance of evaluating smartphone usage patterns in the field of mental health and de-addiction is also highlighted in this clinically oriented review. Despite its many potential benefits, such as social connectivity, educational tools, and financial applications, smartphone addiction has been shown to negatively impact the overall health of adolescents.

They are popular, especially because\xa0they provide these\xa0benefits instantly, due to their portability and size [1].\n\nSmartphones, on\xa0the other hand,\xa0are\xa0technologically more advanced mobile devices, which can perform many of the\xa0functions of a computer, in addition to those of mobile phones, while having the same convenience and form factor.\xa0Given the multifaceted applications of a smartphone, it has also progressively become an intrinsic part of our lives and relationships.\xa0\n\nThe many benefits of a smartphone\xa0like connectivity, increased productivity, availability of information, and portability are, however, balanced by negative health consequences, including neck pain, accidents, poor mental health, and sleep disturbances [2]. Adolescents may be particularly at risk as they are found to be, in addition, watching screens of gaming consoles, TVs, and computers. A systematic review of Indian adolescents revealed that smartphone addiction among adolescents was 39% to 44% on average.\xa0Nearly 300 million of the Indian population uses smartphones [3]. Surveys suggest that up to 50% of teens and 27% of their parents feel that they may be addicted to mobile phones [4].\n\nThese negative health consequences are repeatedly highlighted by the popular press. However, it must\xa0be kept in mind that many of these negative health consequences of smartphone use are speculative and alarmist. Mental health professionals need to have actionable evidence to counsel their clients in a balanced and appropriate manner based on available scientific evidence [5-6].\xa0\n\nThe objective of this clinically oriented comprehensive review was to explore the literature on the impact of smartphone use on sleep in young people and its consequences on their academic achievement. The methodology used was a comprehensive search strategy in Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases using appropriate keywords and Boolean operators.\n\nReview\n\nMethodology\n\nTo conduct this review, a comprehensive search was undertaken using Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Keywords include “adolescents”, “psychiatry and mental health”, “learning”, “sleep pattern”, and "smartphone usage”. The search results were supplemented by reviewing the bibliographies of the articles found, ensuring a thorough exploration of the subject matter related to the influence of smartphone usage on sleep patterns, mental health, and the academic performance of adolescents.\xa0\n\nNegative aspects of widespread smartphone use\n\nPeople using smartphones have problems structuring their daily routines due to the disruptive impact of notifications and screen time. When it comes to students, sleep disturbances may in addition interfere with their ability to reach their classrooms, pay attention, and ability to focus and learn [7]. The result is an inefficient lifestyle with subpar academic outcomes, leading to stress and poor mental health.\xa0Excessive screen time can have multiple negative consequences, the most important of which\xa0are reduced time spent in socialization and sleep. It would be especially\xa0useful to know the impact of screen time on sleep from a bio-psycho-social perspective. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the impact of smartphone use on sleep. First, the bright light emitted suppresses the secretion of melatonin reducing sleep efficiency, delaying sleep onset, and disrupting circadian rhythms [7].\n\nSecond, sleep displacement occurs, when the smartphone is used as an unstructured leisure time activity with no predefined beginning and end point, unlike real-world games and other entertainment activities like attending theatrical performances, movies, and arcades [8].\n\nThird, sleep can be affected by the content consumed through the smartphone such as activating music, arousing sexual or violent images, and video games requiring hyper-alertness to anticipate the required responses. Not surprisingly, studies have found that\xa0mobile phone usage is associated with short sleep duration, reduced\xa0sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. There is also\xa0some evidence to suggest that this relationship may be bidirectional, especially in adults\xa0where insomnia may be the cause and not the outcome of mobile use [8].\n\nThe Millennium Cohort Survey containing 11,553 responses suggested later bedtime and shorter nighttime sleep duration\xa0are associated with hyperactivity and inattention. Indeed sleep deprivation was found to exert a modulatory effect on the onset of psychiatric conditions, including emotional regulation and depression in adolescents [9].\n\nIn particular, bedtime smartphone use is predictive of later rising time, longer sleep latency, and worse sleep efficiency. The screen light emitted by mobile phones is of short wavelength and towards the blue length of the light spectrum, which is likely to delay sleep onset for a long duration after exposure. Therefore, screen time guidelines\xa0have been evolved for the various age groups specifically affected by smartphone addiction [10].\xa0According to the Australian Department of Health (ADH), the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the recommended screen time for\xa0adolescents should not exceed more than two hours per day [11].\xa0\n\nBiological aspects\n\nIn mammals, multiple physiological, endocrine, behavioral, and molecular rhythms are governed by an endogenous clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. It runs freely to a cycle of around 40 minutes and, therefore, needs to be re-synchronized\xa0with 24 hours per day.\xa0To reset this clock and synchronize it with the solar day, the SCN\xa0is entrained daily, by the dark-light cycle to which the organism is exposed [12].\n\nA phase shift in the circadian rhythms of the SCN results in alterations of both the bedtime and wake-up time of an individual which moves to a time earlier in the day (phase advance) or later in the day (phase delay). Light exposure suppresses the melatonin secretion and resets the\xa0phase of the SCN, which depends on the timing, intensity, wavelength, duration, and previous exposures to light or darkness. Light exposure, early in the biological night induces a phase delay while exposure late in the night and towards the early morning elicits a phase advance.\xa0Notably,\xa0these responses are\xa0present in blind people also,\xa0since the photoreceptors wired for the circadian entrainment are distinct from the rods and the cones of the visual system. These circadian photoreceptors have their peak sensitivity to a light wavelength\xa0in the range of 446 to 477 nm (visible short wavelength). Thus, a short wavelength approximately of 460 nm blue light exposure at night evokes a greater phase shift, thus alerting the responses and causing melatonin suppression when compared to other wavelength light in the visual range of 380 to 700 nm. Evidence indicates that these spectrally targeted blue light sources are more efficient in evoking circadian changes such as alertness, faster reaction time, attention lapses, and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while\xa0measuring the electrical activity of the brain [12].\n\nCircadian\xa0photoreceptors in the retina use melanopsin as photopigment. Along with these receptors, there are specialized ganglion cells that project directly to the SCN. Human circadian rhythms like those of other diurnal species are sensitive\xa0to light throughout the biological day. Indeed there is no part of the biological day where light exposure does not affect the circadian rhythms. However, there is a phase delay period\xa0in the early biological night and a phase\xa0advance region in the late biological night with the transition\xa0region occurring late in the biological night. These shifts are evident even with light exposure for a couple of days in a week [12].\xa0\n\nThe human circadian system is sensitive to even low-intensity light especially if it follows many hours of darkness. Most studies show that modern humans get relatively little bright light exposure and spend most of the day in indoor light with an intensity of 200 lux. Such individuals become sensitive to even modest light intensity of 1,000 lux. In addition, even brief flashes of light can be incorporated into the human circadian rhythm if they occur after dark periods. Supplementary to the regular sleep times with darkness during the day, studies have shown that intermittent exposure to bright light throughout the night causes the aligning of the circadian rhythms with the nightshift work schedules [13,14].\n\nThe physiological functions of human beings exhibit approximately a 24-hour rhythm. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the molecular mechanism regulating these rhythms. This molecular mechanism comprises genes that increase the transcription of other genes, whose products, in turn, exert a negative feedback, on their gene expression. This autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop is present in every cell of the body. These feedback loops affect many genes that sub-serve the functioning and the timing of cell biology. These individual cellular clocks are kept in synchrony by the neural network that connects them to the central circadian clock of the organism\xa0[13,14].\n\nIn addition to this genetic mechanism, there have been circadian rhythms noted even in non-nucleated cells such as red blood cells. These non-genetic mechanisms could interact with the gene transcription-translation loops in unknown ways. These mechanisms point to the existence of the primal circadian clock\xa0that could be common to all species. The ability of visible light to synchronize with\xa0the biological clock of the photosynthetic marine dinoflagellate (Gonyaulax polyedra) has been known since 1958 [13,14].\n\nHuman chronobiology\n\nThe SCN\xa0plays a critical role in regulating photoperiodic behavior and physiology such as sleep, wakefulness, alertness, feeding, hunting/ aggressions, seasonal reproduction, body temperature, and hibernation [15].\n\nA photoreceptive net\xa0consisting of the retinal ganglion cells and their axons (containing melanopsin), communicates directly with the brain influencing the circadian rhythms and the pupillary size, through projection to the SCN and the olivary pretectal nuclei, respectively. This photoreceptive system (as opposed to the functionally distinct visual system) encodes and transmits information about the ambient light intensity. Through this system, gross environmental illumination is integrated into the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neural behavioral systems of the human\xa0nervous system. Blue light appears to be the strongest synchronizing agent responsible for resetting the circadian rhythm, to keep the biological rhythms\xa0and the psycho-behavioral rhythms in phase with the solar day [14].\xa0In humans, bright blue light between 0500 and 1700 hours causes a phase advance, while exposure outside this range results in a phase delay. In humans, the altering effects of blue-enriched light (such as those emitted from phone screens) appear to be stronger in the evenings and during the nighttime compared to the morning hours. Bright, continuous, blue light\xa0resets the SCN pacemakers which synchronizes the rhythms of subsidiary cellular clocks which would otherwise run free and go out of phase with each other and out of synchronism with the solar day [15].\n\nSmartphones equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit visible blue light of short wavelength in the range of 446 to 484 nm.\xa0This screen light alters the circadian rhythms and also affects the ocular system: it reduces the melatonin hormone secretions (which is controlled by the SCN and the pineal gland) and decreases the core body temperature and the distal-proximal skin temperature (due to vasodilation of the distal blood vessels), leading to an increased level of sleepiness in the mornings and the evenings. Cortisol secretion by the pituitary gland is also influenced by the SCN. Normally there is a rapid increase in the blood cortisol level 30 to 60 minutes after awakening. One hour of exposure to mobile screen light of wavelength (414 to 800 lux) in dim light\xa0alters the cortisol awakening response. About 30 minutes of exposure to smartphone screen light with a frequency range of 0.50-3.99 Hz also reduces the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the brain, leading to mental disturbances, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety [16].\n\nThese findings have led to the effective use of light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual depression, bulimia, and circadian rhythm disorders related to sleep and dementia [17].\n\nPublic health importance\n\nSleep plays a crucial role in memory symbolization and integration, as noticed by\xa0researchers\xa0over a century ago. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have revealed several compelling findings. These findings indicate that sleep is essential for all the stages of learning. Sleep provides the ideal environment for neural network-level changes in memory representation and stabilizes the brain for long-term retention. Restorative sleep also prepares the brain for new learning [18].\xa0\n\nThese findings must be seen against the background of the widespread sleep curtailment due to smartphone usage and psychosocial stressors, especially in the learning populations (students and trainees). Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the relationships between sleep and academic performance [16]. Although no causative links have been shown to date, the International Agency for Research has identified some\xa0shift schedules\xa0that disrupt the\xa0circadian rhythms which serve as a\xa0potential carcinogen [19]. Melatonin suppression is also shown to be associated with diabetes mellitus type II [19].\n\nA comparable study conducted in Japan aimed at evaluating the effects of mobile phone usage on sleep in adolescents. The results found that the increased phone use after turning off the lights before bed was linked to shorter sleep duration, poor\xa0sleep quality, insomnia, and greater daytime sleepiness [20]. This research highlighted the negative consequences of nighttime phone use on the overall sleep health of adolescents, emphasizing the importance of restricting screen time before sleep.\n\nMultiple recent reviews found that adolescent mental health was significantly impacted by smartphone use. Chronic sleep deprivation leading to reduced cognitive ability/ school performance, social isolation, and self-harm was identified by multiple cross-sectional, longitudinal, and empirical studies in this population [21-23]. Associated comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and excessive alcohol intake were also identified in this population [24,25].\n\nConclusions\n\nThe review was able to flag critical and clinically relevant concerns\xa0of public health importance related to the continuous usage of smartphones. Research has proved that the use of smartphones could disrupt circadian rhythms leading to disturbances in lifestyle, sleep, and multiple cellular biological processes.\n\nIt is mandatory to impose screen time restrictions and document the levels of impairment related to sleep patterns, negative mood swings, and memory loss produced in the learning population and adolescents. Counseling students about the detrimental consequences of smartphone use before bedtime and the significance of getting sufficient sleep for the achievement of academic success is essential. Some researchers have already found that restriction of mobile phone use for 30 minutes before bedtime\xa0has a greater potential for improving sleep, overall mental health, and academic performance of students.\n\nThe clinical importance of evaluating smartphone usage patterns in the field of mental health and de-addiction is also highlighted in this clinically oriented review. Despite its many potential benefits, such as social connectivity, educational tools, and financial applications, smartphone addiction has been shown to negatively impact the overall health of adolescents.\n\nDisclosures\n\nConflicts of interest: In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:\n\nPayment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\nFinancial relationships: All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\nOther relationships: All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConcept and design:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nDrafting of the manuscript:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nCritical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Nischal Krishna Macharla, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Mitthra Suresh, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nSupervision:\xa0 Chandrasekar Palanichamy, Madhusudan Thirunarayanan, Arul Saravanan Ramachandran\n\nReferences\n1.Smartphone addiction among university students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Summary

With the widespread use of portable electronic devices and the normalization of screen media devices in the bedroom, insufficient sleep has become commonplace, affecting 30% of toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children and the majority of adolescents.1,2 In a recent literature review of studies investigating the link between youth screen media use and sleep, 90% of included studies found an association between screen media use and delayed bedtime and/or decreased total sleep time.3 Proposed mechanisms include displacement of time that would have been spent sleeping, psychological stimulation and light exposure, and increased physiological alertness.3 This pervasive phenomenon of pediatric sleep loss has widespread implications due to the associations between insufficient sleep and increased risk of childhood obesity 4, disrupted psychological well-being 5 and impaired cognitive/academic functioning6. There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep loss and health consequences in children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth themselves to foster healthy sleep habits.

Introduction

The widespread use of portable electronic devices and the normalization of screen media devices in the bedroom is accompanied by a high prevalence of insufficient sleep, affecting a majority of adolescents, and 30% of toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children.1,2 Three-fourths of American children and adolescents report the presence of at least one screen-media device in their bedroom, with roughly 60% reporting regular use of these devices during the hour before bedtime.7,8

Parents, educators, and clinicians express concern about whether excessive use of screen media among young people affects sleep and wellbeing. In this article, we provide an overview of the current science on screens and sleep, with a focus on recommendations to reduce the potentially problematic influence of screen time on pediatric sleep. We then review how impaired sleep in pediatric populations may lead to a range of adverse behaviors, physical health problems and well-being outcomes. We begin with a summary of the two consensus statements on child and adolescent sleep needs. Then we summarize the range of screen habits among youth, focusing on screen habits at bedtime. Next, we review current literature on evidence of the effects of youth screen habits on sleep, and the mechanisms by which screen habits may impact sleep. We conclude with evidence-based strategies to improve sleep through sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations and other take-home messages for families and practitioners.

Sleep requirements for children and adolescents

Two independent sleep associations – the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) – each convened teams of sleep researchers and other experts to establish consensuses to guide health care providers and the public about sleep duration requirements across the lifespan, based on the best available evidence. Both groups used a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method9 to arrive at their recommendations. For the pediatric population, the NSF panel recommended that newborns (0–3 months) obtain 14–17 hours of sleep daily, infants (4–11 months) obtain 12–15 hours, toddlers (1–2 years) obtain 11–14 hours, preschoolers (3–5 years) obtain 10–13 hours, school-aged children (6–13 years) obtain 9–11 hours, and teenagers (14–17 years) obtain 8–10 hours.10 The AASM recommendations were identical to those of the NSF, except the former suggested that infants aged 4–12 months obtain 12–16 hours of sleep per day (including naps) and children aged 6–12 obtain 9–12 hours.11

Consequences of insufficient sleep for cognitive, psychological and physical wellbeing

Sleep problems in early life predict a greater likelihood of later development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence.12 In a large study (N= 32,662), short sleep duration (≤ 10h/night by maternal report) and nocturnal awakenings (≥ 3/night) in toddlers were associated with development of behavioral and emotional problems at age 5.13 Sleep problems at age 4 have been found to predict a greater incidence of behavioral and emotional problems emerging by mid-adolescence.14 In experimental studies, toddler napping appears to be important for self-regulation. A challenging puzzle task following 5 days of regular napping (compared to non-napping) elicited fewer perseverative behaviors, and less negative self-appraisals.15 Imposing sleep restriction on healthy teens rapidly degrades mood and emotion regulation16, as with adults. A large cross-sectional study of adolescents identified associations between short sleep duration and emotional problems, peer conflict, and suicidal ideation.17 In a meta-analysis of longitudinal and intervention studies, adolescent sleep problems appear to precede the emergence of depression.18 Although more work on the modifiable aspects of sleep duration, sleep quality, and regularity of sleep timing are needed, current literature suggests that each of these factors is important for psychological health. These relationships may be bi-directional, as sleep and psychological problems influence one another throughout development,19 suggesting a resonance phenomenon or a vicious cycle that may be exacerbated by excessive screen media habits. Williams and colleagues have proposed a Developmental Cascade Model, supported by longitudinal data on children, to explain the reciprocal interactions of sleep and emotion and attention self-regulation.20

Beyond emotional and behavioral problems, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies revealed that short sleep duration was reliably associated with weight gain, adiposity, and obesity risk in both children and adults.4 Infants obtaining less than 12 hours of sleep/day, measured by maternal report, were more likely to be overweight at age 3 and have higher levels of adiposity.21 In a longitudinal study of children age 1 to age 7, sleep duration was associated with greater BMI increases, fat mass, and waist-to-hip ratio.22 In a controlled, laboratory-based experimental study, 3-year old children exposed to acute sleep restriction (skipping a nap and bedtime delayed ~2.3 hours) consumed greater amounts of carbohydrate and fat and more total calories23, which may explain the elevated risk of obesity caused by insufficient sleep. A recent review identified sleep as among the socioeconomic, family, environmental, and behavioral factors contributing to childhood obesity.24

In a longitudinal study of children in 3rd grade, bedtimes after 8pm were associated with greater odds of increased adiposity measured at 6th grade. As with children, insufficient sleep in adolescence has been shown to promote dietary behaviors that lead to obesity25, with additional effects mediated via decreased physical activity and neuroendocrine changes that bolster fat storage. More evidence is needed, particularly in interventions that counteract the effects of screen-media consumption leading to insufficient quantity or inadequate quality sleep, that in turn influence weight gain in childhood. However, the “weight” of available evidence suggests that obesity may be a sleep loss-related outcome of excessive screen-media consumption.

What are the bedtime screen habits of infants, children, and adolescents?

Although the scientific and clinical communities continue to express concern regarding the negative impacts of screen media on sleep, electronics in the bedroom and screen time use around bedtime remain common among youth.26–28 A large-scale, nationally representative sample of American parents in 201326 revealed that about one third (36%) of young children had TVs in their bedrooms, including 16% of children under 2 years of age, 37% of 2- to 4-year-olds, and 45% of 5- to 8-year-olds. Additionally, among parents of infants and young children who allowed a bedroom TV, 22% did so to help their child fall asleep, 14% did so to get their child to fall asleep in his/her own room, and 4% did so because their child slept in a family room containing a TV.26 The presence of a TV in the bedroom varies by cultural, socioeconomic and structural factors. Data from a 2016 nationally representative study of over 2,600 US youth indicated that 47% of tweens and 57% of teens have TVs in their bedrooms.27 Media devices in the bedroom were more common in lower-income youth (68% versus 37%). The authors speculated that the higher rate of media in the bedrooms of lower-income tweens and teens may be the result of more frequent room sharing, sleeping in a multi-purposed room, or differing family preferences. Parent-report data from the 2014 Sleep in America poll by the NSF revealed that 75% of youth keep at least one type of electronic device in their bedroom. The poll also found that the 28% of school-aged children and 57% of teenagers who leave an electronic device on in their bedroom after bedtime obtained less total sleep and had lower sleep quality.7

About 50% of parents endorse the belief that watching TV helps their infant, toddler, or preschooler ‘wind down’ in the evening.28 Likewise, multiple studies documented that adolescents report using media at bedtime to “help” them fall asleep.29 There is a current programming trend toward developing calming shows and apps aimed at helping children relax before bedtime and transition to sleep. To our knowledge, no published research exists on the effectiveness of such content. Such evidence should be a minimum requirement for these approaches to be recommended.

Importantly, over the past decade, the landscape of screen media devices has changed markedly, dramatically altering children and adolescents engage with their environment. Data from large national US samples in 2011 and 2013 show an increase in ownership of tablet devices in young children (age 0–8) from 8% to 40% and an increase in access to mobile “smart” devices at home from 52% to 75%.26 Another report indicated that, from 2011 to 2013, the percentage of children under 2 years of age who had used a mobile device rose from 10% to 38%.26

Screen media, especially near bedtime, is adversely associated with sleep time and quantity

In relation to a growing interest in the association between screen time and sleep patterns, data from over 60 associated studies have been examined in two systematic literature reviews3,30 and two related meta-analyses31,32. In the time since those articles were published, at least a dozen more studies have surfaced (e.g., see6,8,33–42), from a wide-range of cultural contexts including Thailand,37 Saudi Arabia,40 and Norway.8

The vast majority of these studies indicate that the extent of screen time among children and adolescents is associated with delayed bedtime and shorter total sleep time 43–45. Several studies also found associations between screen time and reduced sleep quality,46,47 longer sleep onset latency,48 and increased daytime tiredness.49,50 One recent study found that electronic media use accounted for 30% of all variance in adolescent sleep efficiency, as measured by actigraphy.34 Most studies examined total daily screen time as a predictor, but even greater effects on sleep have been documented in evening media use in the bedroom (i.e., in the 1–2 hours before bedtime51,52) and in use of violent media at any time.53,54

One meta-analysis investigated the association between portable screen-based media devices and sleep outcomes.32 Merging results from 20 studies and over 125,000 youth, the authors consistently found that bedtime media usage is associated with insufficient sleep duration (OR=2.17, p<.001), poor sleep quality (OR=1.46, p<.01) and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR=2.72, p<0.01). This meta-analysis found that the mere presence of a portable screen-based media device in the bedroom has adverse associations with sleep outcomes. In one study of 600 preschoolers, those with a TV in their bedroom watched twice as much evening TV (about 28 versus 13 minutes, respectively) and watched more shows with violent/scary or ‘mature’ content (29% versus 13%).53 Most related studies focused on typically-developing children, but results of studies on children with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorders show similar patterns. One such study found that exposure to violent programming within 30 minutes before bedtime was associated with longer sleep latency and shorter sleep duration.54

Negative associations with sleep have been found with use of a range of screen media devices, including television, computers, video games, and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.29,51,52,55–65 However, there are mixed results regarding whether the type, size, or interactivity level of the screen affects sleep outcomes. In a study of 2,048 children in grades four and seven, having either a TV or small screen device near where they sleep – as well as more daily screen time– was associated with obtaining less sleep.6 The rise in interactive media options may increase the impact of media use on sleep, as some studies have found that interactive screen media use (e.g. video games and mobile devices) may have a greater impact on sleep than passive use, such as watching television.6,45,66–71 One recent meta-analysis found no association between television watching and sleep duration,31 but did find that computer use is associated with shorter total sleep duration. Another study shows that use of interactive screen-media increases the odds of nighttime awakenings and daytime tiredness,41 but other studies examining the effects of video game use on sleep have shown more modest effects.68,72 One study compared 1 hour of bedtime tablet use with three different lighting profiles and found minimal differences in the impact on sleep and next-day functioning.73 However, longer durations of bright screen use (between 1.5–5 hours) have shown to increase alertness before sleep.74–77

Mechanisms through which screens affect sleep

Since many of the existing studies are observational and cross-sectional, causality is difficult to discern. Several potential mechanisms, along with supporting evidence, are briefly discussed below: time displacement, psychological stimulation from content, and the alerting and circadian effects of light.

Time displacement of sleep

Screen media use can lead to behavioral bedtime delay, as children or adolescents postpone bedtime to prolong screen entertainment.66,78,79 Using a screen-based device displaces time that would otherwise have been spent sleeping. This time-displacement mechanism is particularly powerful when screens are used at night, when sleep is most likely the activity being directly offset.

Psychological stimulation from media content disrupting sleep

Research has found mixed results regarding the effect of screen media use on psychological, emotional, and/or physiological arousal, but this relationship likely mediates some effect of screen media use on sleep.80–83 Video games, particularly violent games, are often thrilling for enthusiasts, typically simulating life-or-death experiences requiring players’ full attention to succeed. Violent videogame play before bed increase arousal compared to nonviolent gameplay. However, arousal is a likely mediator of sleep problems even in non-violent media use.46 In another controlled experiment, playing an “exciting” video game was associated with increased heart rate, slightly delayed sleep-onset, and decreased REM sleep, further suggesting that the effect of screen use on sleep is mediated via arousal.61

Effects of light-emitting screens on child and adolescent sleep

Exposure to the light emitted by screens in the evening hours before and/or during bedtime is another likely mechanism by which use of screen media negatively impacts sleep. Screen-based light may affect sleep via several pathways:

increasing arousal and reducing sleepiness at bedtime,

disrupting sleep architecture as assessed by polysomnographic (PSG) recording, and

delaying the circadian rhythm and subsequently postponing sleep-onset, which results in shortened sleep duration unless wake-time is also delayed.

Studies of young adults demonstrated that evening use of light-emitting devices increases alertness and decreases sleepiness before bedtime, as determined by cognitive performance, self-reported scales and waking EEG measures.74,76,84 These studies also showed that this light suppresses blood levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which normally increases in the hours before bedtime.74,76,77,84 Similar results were found in an experimental study of adolescents, in which exposure to LED screens before bedtime decreased self-reported sleepiness and melatonin levels.75 Exposure to non-screen artificial light in the evening also increases alertness (quelling underlying sleep drive) and suppresses melatonin levels, delaying sleep onset. The light emitted from screen media devices includes greater short-wavelength light in the blue light range, which has been shown to induce stronger melatonin-suppressing responses 85. In fact, in the aforementioned study of adolescents75, both subjective alertness and melatonin suppression were significantly attenuated when study participants wore glasses that filtered out short-wavelength light.

Few studies have directly measured the effects of light from screens on polysomnographic (PSG) measures of sleep.73,75,76 One such study in young adults found that exposure to light-emitting devices before bedtime caused a phase delay of melatonin release and modestly increased the time to fall asleep and reduced the duration of REM sleep76. It is impossible to determine whether longer sleep latency or reduced REM sleep duration was due to decreased sleepiness before bedtime, suppression of melatonin, a phase delay of the circadian clock, or a combination of these factors. Other published reports, including a study of adolescents,73 found no significant changes on subsequent PSG with evening exposure to light-emitting devices.73,75

Although limited research documents the effects of light from digital media on sleep, the results are particularly applicable to youth, who may be more sensitive to light than adults.86 One study 87 found that the magnitude of melatonin suppression induced by moderately bright indoor light levels in the evening was twice as much in primary school children as in adults. This difference could be related to pupil diameter, which is significantly larger in children than adults. Another study88 found that children showed significantly greater melatonin suppression compared to adolescents in response to varying degrees of evening light exposure. Taken together, these results suggest that the light from screen media use around bedtime adversely affects sleep, particularly in younger children. Furthermore, these findings indicate the need for further research on the effect of screen media devices on sleep, especially in youth.

Internet and video game addiction and sleep

There is growing concern that technology habits can become uncontrollable and excessive to the point of interference with normal daily functioning. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V (DSM-V) recognizes one type of technology addiction, internet gaming disorder, as a “condition for further study”.89 More broadly, the concept of internet and video game addiction (IVGA), has gained traction in the psychological and psychiatric communities, due in part to the disorder’s deleterious effects on sleep. IVGA is classified as an inability of internet users to limit excessive internet use, with ensuing psychosocial dysfunction.90 A recent systematic literature review and other studies show a particularly strong association between use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and poor sleep quality.91–93 IVGA has been associated with subjective insomnia and insufficient sleep among afflicted adolescents.91 Existing literature on this association remains limited and causality is unproven, but there appears to be a strong association between IVGA and sleep problems.

Moderating factors

New evidence suggests some young people are particularly susceptible to the ill effects of screen media on sleep quality. As early as 2009, researchers documented individual differences in teenagers’ heart rate variability (HRV) when playing violent video games.83 A subsequent study46 demonstrated that adolescents’ level of gaming experience moderated the effect between their videogame use, HRV, and sleep. Inexperienced gamers reported poorer sleep after playing a violent video game, in contrast to experienced gamers who reported poorer sleep after a nonviolent videogame. Physiological trait differences can also amplify technology exposure effects by directly delaying bedtimes.52 An experimental laboratory study by Reynolds and colleagues79 revealed that adolescents who perceived fewer consequences from risk-taking were more likely to end daily video gaming sessions at a later time, thus delaying sleep onset, compared with their peers. Smith et al.94 found that adolescents who self-reported higher trait flow (the ability to easily immerse oneself into an activity) were also more likely to delay bedtime via extended periods of evening gaming. Their follow-up laboratory study replicated this effect, but only for videogames that were both challenging and enjoyable (i.e. when game difficulty was set to “hard” instead of “easy”). Similarly, poor self-control in combination with unstructured television viewing has been associated with delayed bedtimes in adults, a finding supported in a follow-up study.95 This emerging research suggests that identifying predisposing individual traits and characteristics of the technology use helps discern youth whose technology habits are most likely to delay sleep onset.

Interventions, policies and strategies designed to improve child and adolescent sleep

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a Statement of Endorsement in support of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines, which recommends that screen-based devices not be allowed in children’s bedrooms and be turned off 30 minutes before bedtime.96 These are commonly suggested approaches, but modifying media content may be another effective means of protecting sleep. A randomized trial found that a harm-reduction intervention, which attempted to change the media exposure of preschool children away from violent and towards educational and prosocial content, significantly decreased odds of sleep problems across follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 months, compared with controls.97

Experimental studies seeking to evaluate interventions to improve sleep outcomes in children and adolescents are sparse, and have typically incorporated multifaceted sleep hygiene programs that address multiple elements in addition to screen media before bed. Nevertheless, existing literature suggests that limiting screen time during the 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime may yield modest benefits in terms of “lights out time” as well as sleep quality and duration. A one-week program, consisting of classes teaching sleep physiology, biological significance, and consequences of sleep deprivation, resulted in more regular bedtimes and shorter sleep-onset latency among 58 adolescents (mean 16 years old), but no benefit on sleep quality or daytime sleepiness.98 Another investigation assessed the utility the FERRET (Food, Emotions, Routine, Restrict, Environment and Timing) sleep hygiene program among 22 adolescents (mean 13 years old). FERRET instructed adolescents to comply with three rules for each of the domains of the acronym (e.g. Restrict: No electronic media at least 30 minutes before bed, no exercise 3 hours before bed, no other activities in bed except for sleep).99 This program significantly improved scores on the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), although objective sleep duration did not change significantly. A targeted intervention of mobile phone restriction in the hour before bed among 63 adolescents (mean 16 years old) resulted in “lights out” 17 minutes earlier and a total sleep time increase of 19 minutes per night.100 However, the authors reported a low 26% recruitment rate, highlighting the difficulty of implementing such a regimented screen-limiting schedule in teens. In another study, limiting screen media around bedtime for healthy adolescents with good sleep did not significantly impact sleep outcomes. In a study of high school athletes (mean 17 years) whose baseline consisted of sufficient sleep (e.g. total sleep time, 7:49 weekdays, 9:11 weekends), a strict “no electronic media” rule after 10:00 pm resulted in no benefit in terms of total sleep time, sleep quality, or daytime functioning.101 In sum, limited existing research suggests that sleep hygiene interventions may be practically challenging to achieve but yield benefits to those children and adolescents with insufficent sleep. Larger, multi-site studies are urgently needed given the increasing intrusion of evening screen media use in of the lives of modern youth, including gaming, social media, and homework.

Clinician’s perspective

Clinicians can help families improve their sleep health and screen media habits by encouraging parenting marked by high levels of warmth and support, as well as limits that are clearly communicated, consistently applied appropriate to the child’s behavior and context, and allow for developmentally appropriate autonomy(i.e. an authoritative parenting style). 102,103 (See Box 1) All parents should begin instilling family bedtime routines and healthy sleep habits early in life, and adjust these routines as youth mature (See Box 2). If the youth health behaviors and habits become part of the child’s own daily routine, she will be better able to take charge of her own sleep health behaviors when this becomes appropriate in later years. For younger children, these routines mean establishing household rules related to screens and sleep early on. For older children and adolescents, they involve open conversation about the core reasons for behaviors. This proactive and engaged parenting style promotes cooperation and parent-child shared goals for children’s health and well-being, and aims to help children develop self-regulation skills, and eventually increasing autonomy to govern their own behavior.

Box 2. Sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for parents.

Establish screen media habits for your children which enable healthy sleep.3,7,113

Plan a bedtime that allows for adequate sleep.

Avoid screen media in the hour before bedtime and at nighttime.

Replace evening screen time with calm activities for your children (reading, coloring, conversation, etc.).

Keep all screen devices (TVs, video games, computers, tablets, and smartphones) out of bedrooms.

Avoid passive background media: Children may be affected by screen media even when they are not actively engaged.

Content matters: Avoid violent and/or scary media, which can negatively affect your children’s sleep.

Family rules/routines are most effective when applied to all children in the household.

Establish other healthy sleep practices for your child and yourself.112,114,115

Set and abide by regular bedtimes every day, including weekends, allowing the child sufficient sleep duration for his/her age.10

Bedtime should follow a predictable routine (e.g.: brush teeth, read a story, lights out).

Bedrooms should be cool (65–70 degrees), comfortable, dark, and quiet.

Avoid evening intake of chocolate or beverages that interfere with sleep (soda, tea, coffee, energy drinks).

Include physical exercise into the daily routine, and spend time outdoors during sunlight hours when possible.

Be a healthy sleep role model by prioritizing your own sleep.

Improve your own sleep-related behaviors (e.g., reduce screen time before bedtime, establish a regular bedtime, etc.)114 to improve your health and well-being116

Turn off electronic media devices in the evening throughout the household and charge all mobile devices in a central location outside bedrooms.

Parents who are overtired are less well able to parent effectively, including being proactive in orchestrating child routines and dealing effectively and calmly with daily hassles that are part of everyday life.

Parent your child with clear communication, awareness, and fair, consistent, developmentally appropriate rules.117

Talk with your child or teen early and often about the importance of adequate sleep for optimal health.

Be aware of how much time your child or teen spends engaging in screen media, including before and after bedtime.76

Pay attention to your child or teen’s mood and behavior at home, and discuss concerns you may have. Mood impairment is often caused by inadequate sleep.

Establish and enforce appropriate media and sleep rules for your children as early in their lives as possible; consistently point out after-effects of failing to follow those rules (e.g., being tired and cranky the next day after playing games too late) to develop your child’s understanding of the effects of inadequate sleep.

Work with teens to jointly develop healthy sleep routines that also allow them to meet obligations (e.g., homework or sports) and are consistent with the guidelines above. Developing autonomy and ability to self-regulate is important for teens, as is consistency.

Examples from health psychology provide accessible guidance. A teen with a healthy diet does not typically result from the rigid imposition of a such a diet after a lifetime of unhealthy foods, but with a healthy and balanced eating habits instilled from a young age. A healthy “screen media diet” may be a resonant and useful concept for many children, parents, educators, and clinicians. It is difficult for parents who smoke to mandate a no-smoking policy. Role modeling and a health-risk prevention approach is far more likely to be effective than a secondary prevention approach (e.g smoking cessation). Successful parenting ideally starts early and sets appropriate norms and boundaries while maintaining parental warmth, rather than holding off on setting boundaries until a problem develops requiring discipline. Encouraging the development of age-appropriate autonomy will help teenagers to develop a sense of responsibility for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

For teenagers presenting with excessive screen time, a few clinical pearls may help families to follow the recommendations laid out in Box 1 and 2, below. First, one must always focus on the chief complaint, what brought the patient to seek help in the first place. In cases of excessive nighttime screen media use, children and adolescents are often seen in the clinician’s office for poor academic performance or lack of concentration in school. Upon taking a careful history, the clinician often discovers a significant lack of sleep, often attributable to patients staying up late while using mobile devices, computers, or videogames. Clinicians must discover the underlying factors (e.g., social or family stress) which drive the patient to use the screens in the late hours. Addressing such factors directly may be essential to motivating families to achieve healthier screen habits.

The clinicians should then work with families to reduce evening and nighttime screen media use via structural and behavioral modifications in order to improve sleep health (See Box 2). Many adolescents are reluctant to change their health behaviors,104 yet providing them with education about the positive benefits of sufficient sleep as well as the negative consequences of poor sleep can help motivate such change.105–109 For example, pointing out that a change in sleep habits may improve concentration, daytime alertness, and academic performance may motivate youth to modify nighttime habits. Discussing the negative repercussions of inadequate sleep on qualities that are important to the patient, such as body weight or athletic performance, may likewise motivate the patient to reduce nighttime screen media use and establish other healthy bedtime habits. Perhaps most importantly, parents and children should remove screen-based devices from the bedroom to ensure that they are not used at night.

Changing bedtime screen media use habits in our young patients is challenging. However, several tools and strategies increase our chances of success, with the goal of promoting healthy sleep habits that children and adolescents will continue to follow throughout their lives.

Recommendations for clinicians, educators, and parents

Based on our current understanding of clinical practice and sleep health research, we have developed sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for clinicians and educators (see Box 1) and for parents (see Box 2) to help minimize the adverse effects of screen-based media on the sleep of children and adolescents.

Future directions

Research indicates that screen-based media represents a threat to the sleep quality of youth, many of whom already have insufficient sleep. However, very few studies demonstrate easy-to-implement and effective interventions. Future research should develop, implement, and evaluate sustainable interventions that minimize the adverse effects of evening screen use on sleep. For example, a means of reducing fear of missing out from social media and other screen-based activities may significantly improve the sleep of adolescents.110,111 There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research into the effects of screen-based media on sleep and related health consequences among children and adolescents, in order to educate and motivate parents, clinicians, teachers, and youth to foster healthy sleep habits.

Key points.

Use of screen media by youth, throughout the day and in the period before bedtime, is associated with shorter total sleep time and delayed sleep onset in over five dozen studies from around the world. Access to a screen-media device in the bedroom at night is associated with shorter sleep duration, later bedtime, and poorer sleep quality.

The currently-supported mechanisms underlying the relationship between screen media habits and sleep outcomes include (1) displacement of time spent sleeping by time spent using screens, (2) psychological stimulation from screen-media content, and (3) alerting and circadian effects of exposure to light from screens.

Clinicians, educators, and parents should prioritize the need of youth to get sufficient sleep through maintaining regular and consistent bedtime routines. In addition, youth and parents should practice sleep-friendly screen behaviors: restricting exposure to digital media in the hour before bedtime, turning devices off during the night, and keeping devices out of bedrooms. Modifying media content to reduce psychological stimulation (e.g., limiting violent or scary media) may also reduce adverse impact on sleep.

There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep and related health and health behavior consequences among children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth to maintain healthy sleep habits.

There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep loss and health consequences in children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth themselves to foster healthy sleep habits.\n\nKeywords: youth, screen media habits, sleep, screen-behavior recommendations\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe widespread use of portable electronic devices and the normalization of screen media devices in the bedroom is accompanied by a high prevalence of insufficient sleep, affecting a majority of adolescents, and 30% of toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children.1,2 Three-fourths of American children and adolescents report the presence of at least one screen-media device in their bedroom, with roughly 60% reporting regular use of these devices during the hour before bedtime.7,8\n\nParents, educators, and clinicians express concern about whether excessive use of screen media among young people affects sleep and wellbeing. In this article, we provide an overview of the current science on screens and sleep, with a focus on recommendations to reduce the potentially problematic influence of screen time on pediatric sleep. We then review how impaired sleep in pediatric populations may lead to a range of adverse behaviors, physical health problems and well-being outcomes. We begin with a summary of the two consensus statements on child and adolescent sleep needs. Then we summarize the range of screen habits among youth, focusing on screen habits at bedtime. Next, we review current literature on evidence of the effects of youth screen habits on sleep, and the mechanisms by which screen habits may impact sleep. We conclude with evidence-based strategies to improve sleep through sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations and other take-home messages for families and practitioners.\n\nSleep requirements for children and adolescents\n\nTwo independent sleep associations – the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) – each convened teams of sleep researchers and other experts to establish consensuses to guide health care providers and the public about sleep duration requirements across the lifespan, based on the best available evidence. Both groups used a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method9 to arrive at their recommendations. For the pediatric population, the NSF panel recommended that newborns (0–3 months) obtain 14–17 hours of sleep daily, infants (4–11 months) obtain 12–15 hours, toddlers (1–2 years) obtain 11–14 hours, preschoolers (3–5 years) obtain 10–13 hours, school-aged children (6–13 years) obtain 9–11 hours, and teenagers (14–17 years) obtain 8–10 hours.10 The AASM recommendations were identical to those of the NSF, except the former suggested that infants aged 4–12 months obtain 12–16 hours of sleep per day (including naps) and children aged 6–12 obtain 9–12 hours.11\n\nConsequences of insufficient sleep for cognitive, psychological and physical wellbeing\n\nSleep problems in early life predict a greater likelihood of later development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence.12 In a large study (N= 32,662), short sleep duration (≤ 10h/night by maternal report) and nocturnal awakenings (≥ 3/night) in toddlers were associated with development of behavioral and emotional problems at age 5.13 Sleep problems at age 4 have been found to predict a greater incidence of behavioral and emotional problems emerging by mid-adolescence.14 In experimental studies, toddler napping appears to be important for self-regulation. A challenging puzzle task following 5 days of regular napping (compared to non-napping) elicited fewer perseverative behaviors, and less negative self-appraisals.15 Imposing sleep restriction on healthy teens rapidly degrades mood and emotion regulation16, as with adults. A large cross-sectional study of adolescents identified associations between short sleep duration and emotional problems, peer conflict, and suicidal ideation.17 In a meta-analysis of longitudinal and intervention studies, adolescent sleep problems appear to precede the emergence of depression.18 Although more work on the modifiable aspects of sleep duration, sleep quality, and regularity of sleep timing are needed, current literature suggests that each of these factors is important for psychological health. These relationships may be bi-directional, as sleep and psychological problems influence one another throughout development,19 suggesting a resonance phenomenon or a vicious cycle that may be exacerbated by excessive screen media habits. Williams and colleagues have proposed a Developmental Cascade Model, supported by longitudinal data on children, to explain the reciprocal interactions of sleep and emotion and attention self-regulation.20\n\nBeyond emotional and behavioral problems, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies revealed that short sleep duration was reliably associated with weight gain, adiposity, and obesity risk in both children and adults.4 Infants obtaining less than 12 hours of sleep/day, measured by maternal report, were more likely to be overweight at age 3 and have higher levels of adiposity.21 In a longitudinal study of children age 1 to age 7, sleep duration was associated with greater BMI increases, fat mass, and waist-to-hip ratio.22 In a controlled, laboratory-based experimental study, 3-year old children exposed to acute sleep restriction (skipping a nap and bedtime delayed ~2.3 hours) consumed greater amounts of carbohydrate and fat and more total calories23, which may explain the elevated risk of obesity caused by insufficient sleep. A recent review identified sleep as among the socioeconomic, family, environmental, and behavioral factors contributing to childhood obesity.24\n\nIn a longitudinal study of children in 3rd grade, bedtimes after 8pm were associated with greater odds of increased adiposity measured at 6th grade. As with children, insufficient sleep in adolescence has been shown to promote dietary behaviors that lead to obesity25, with additional effects mediated via decreased physical activity and neuroendocrine changes that bolster fat storage. More evidence is needed, particularly in interventions that counteract the effects of screen-media consumption leading to insufficient quantity or inadequate quality sleep, that in turn influence weight gain in childhood. However, the “weight” of available evidence suggests that obesity may be a sleep loss-related outcome of excessive screen-media consumption.\n\nWhat are the bedtime screen habits of infants, children, and adolescents?\n\nAlthough the scientific and clinical communities continue to express concern regarding the negative impacts of screen media on sleep, electronics in the bedroom and screen time use around bedtime remain common among youth.26–28 A large-scale, nationally representative sample of American parents in 201326 revealed that about one third (36%) of young children had TVs in their bedrooms, including 16% of children under 2 years of age, 37% of 2- to 4-year-olds, and 45% of 5- to 8-year-olds. Additionally, among parents of infants and young children who allowed a bedroom TV, 22% did so to help their child fall asleep, 14% did so to get their child to fall asleep in his/her own room, and 4% did so because their child slept in a family room containing a TV.26 The presence of a TV in the bedroom varies by cultural, socioeconomic and structural factors. Data from a 2016 nationally representative study of over 2,600 US youth indicated that 47% of tweens and 57% of teens have TVs in their bedrooms.27 Media devices in the bedroom were more common in lower-income youth (68% versus 37%). The authors speculated that the higher rate of media in the bedrooms of lower-income tweens and teens may be the result of more frequent room sharing, sleeping in a multi-purposed room, or differing family preferences. Parent-report data from the 2014 Sleep in America poll by the NSF revealed that 75% of youth keep at least one type of electronic device in their bedroom. The poll also found that the 28% of school-aged children and 57% of teenagers who leave an electronic device on in their bedroom after bedtime obtained less total sleep and had lower sleep quality.7\n\nAbout 50% of parents endorse the belief that watching TV helps their infant, toddler, or preschooler ‘wind down’ in the evening.28 Likewise, multiple studies documented that adolescents report using media at bedtime to “help” them fall asleep.29 There is a current programming trend toward developing calming shows and apps aimed at helping children relax before bedtime and transition to sleep. To our knowledge, no published research exists on the effectiveness of such content. Such evidence should be a minimum requirement for these approaches to be recommended.\n\nImportantly, over the past decade, the landscape of screen media devices has changed markedly, dramatically altering children and adolescents engage with their environment. Data from large national US samples in 2011 and 2013 show an increase in ownership of tablet devices in young children (age 0–8) from 8% to 40% and an increase in access to mobile “smart” devices at home from 52% to 75%.26 Another report indicated that, from 2011 to 2013, the percentage of children under 2 years of age who had used a mobile device rose from 10% to 38%.26\n\nScreen media, especially near bedtime, is adversely associated with sleep time and quantity\n\nIn relation to a growing interest in the association between screen time and sleep patterns, data from over 60 associated studies have been examined in two systematic literature reviews3,30 and two related meta-analyses31,32. In the time since those articles were published, at least a dozen more studies have surfaced (e.g., see6,8,33–42), from a wide-range of cultural contexts including Thailand,37 Saudi Arabia,40 and Norway.8\n\nThe vast majority of these studies indicate that the extent of screen time among children and adolescents is associated with delayed bedtime and shorter total sleep time 43–45. Several studies also found associations between screen time and reduced sleep quality,46,47 longer sleep onset latency,48 and increased daytime tiredness.49,50 One recent study found that electronic media use accounted for 30% of all variance in adolescent sleep efficiency, as measured by actigraphy.34 Most studies examined total daily screen time as a predictor, but even greater effects on sleep have been documented in evening media use in the bedroom (i.e., in the 1–2 hours before bedtime51,52) and in use of violent media at any time.53,54\n\nOne meta-analysis investigated the association between portable screen-based media devices and sleep outcomes.32 Merging results from 20 studies and over 125,000 youth, the authors consistently found that bedtime media usage is associated with insufficient sleep duration (OR=2.17, p<.001), poor sleep quality (OR=1.46, p<.01) and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR=2.72, p<0.01). This meta-analysis found that the mere presence of a portable screen-based media device in the bedroom has adverse associations with sleep outcomes. In one study of 600 preschoolers, those with a TV in their bedroom watched twice as much evening TV (about 28 versus 13 minutes, respectively) and watched more shows with violent/scary or ‘mature’ content (29% versus 13%).53 Most related studies focused on typically-developing children, but results of studies on children with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorders show similar patterns. One such study found that exposure to violent programming within 30 minutes before bedtime was associated with longer sleep latency and shorter sleep duration.54\n\nNegative associations with sleep have been found with use of a range of screen media devices, including television, computers, video games, and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.29,51,52,55–65 However, there are mixed results regarding whether the type, size, or interactivity level of the screen affects sleep outcomes. In a study of 2,048 children in grades four and seven, having either a TV or small screen device near where they sleep – as well as more daily screen time– was associated with obtaining less sleep.6 The rise in interactive media options may increase the impact of media use on sleep, as some studies have found that interactive screen media use (e.g. video games and mobile devices) may have a greater impact on sleep than passive use, such as watching television.6,45,66–71 One recent meta-analysis found no association between television watching and sleep duration,31 but did find that computer use is associated with shorter total sleep duration. Another study shows that use of interactive screen-media increases the odds of nighttime awakenings and daytime tiredness,41 but other studies examining the effects of video game use on sleep have shown more modest effects.68,72 One study compared 1 hour of bedtime tablet use with three different lighting profiles and found minimal differences in the impact on sleep and next-day functioning.73 However, longer durations of bright screen use (between 1.5–5 hours) have shown to increase alertness before sleep.74–77\n\nMechanisms through which screens affect sleep\n\nSince many of the existing studies are observational and cross-sectional, causality is difficult to discern. Several potential mechanisms, along with supporting evidence, are briefly discussed below: time displacement, psychological stimulation from content, and the alerting and circadian effects of light.\n\nTime displacement of sleep\n\nScreen media use can lead to behavioral bedtime delay, as children or adolescents postpone bedtime to prolong screen entertainment.66,78,79 Using a screen-based device displaces time that would otherwise have been spent sleeping. This time-displacement mechanism is particularly powerful when screens are used at night, when sleep is most likely the activity being directly offset.\n\nPsychological stimulation from media content disrupting sleep\n\nResearch has found mixed results regarding the effect of screen media use on psychological, emotional, and/or physiological arousal, but this relationship likely mediates some effect of screen media use on sleep.80–83 Video games, particularly violent games, are often thrilling for enthusiasts, typically simulating life-or-death experiences requiring players’ full attention to succeed. Violent videogame play before bed increase arousal compared to nonviolent gameplay. However, arousal is a likely mediator of sleep problems even in non-violent media use.46 In another controlled experiment, playing an “exciting” video game was associated with increased heart rate, slightly delayed sleep-onset, and decreased REM sleep, further suggesting that the effect of screen use on sleep is mediated via arousal.61\n\nEffects of light-emitting screens on child and adolescent sleep\n\nExposure to the light emitted by screens in the evening hours before and/or during bedtime is another likely mechanism by which use of screen media negatively impacts sleep. Screen-based light may affect sleep via several pathways:\n\nincreasing arousal and reducing sleepiness at bedtime,\n\ndisrupting sleep architecture as assessed by polysomnographic (PSG) recording, and\n\ndelaying the circadian rhythm and subsequently postponing sleep-onset, which results in shortened sleep duration unless wake-time is also delayed.\n\nStudies of young adults demonstrated that evening use of light-emitting devices increases alertness and decreases sleepiness before bedtime, as determined by cognitive performance, self-reported scales and waking EEG measures.74,76,84 These studies also showed that this light suppresses blood levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which normally increases in the hours before bedtime.74,76,77,84 Similar results were found in an experimental study of adolescents, in which exposure to LED screens before bedtime decreased self-reported sleepiness and melatonin levels.75 Exposure to non-screen artificial light in the evening also increases alertness (quelling underlying sleep drive) and suppresses melatonin levels, delaying sleep onset. The light emitted from screen media devices includes greater short-wavelength light in the blue light range, which has been shown to induce stronger melatonin-suppressing responses 85. In fact, in the aforementioned study of adolescents75, both subjective alertness and melatonin suppression were significantly attenuated when study participants wore glasses that filtered out short-wavelength light.\n\nFew studies have directly measured the effects of light from screens on polysomnographic (PSG) measures of sleep.73,75,76 One such study in young adults found that exposure to light-emitting devices before bedtime caused a phase delay of melatonin release and modestly increased the time to fall asleep and reduced the duration of REM sleep76. It is impossible to determine whether longer sleep latency or reduced REM sleep duration was due to decreased sleepiness before bedtime, suppression of melatonin, a phase delay of the circadian clock, or a combination of these factors. Other published reports, including a study of adolescents,73 found no significant changes on subsequent PSG with evening exposure to light-emitting devices.73,75\n\nAlthough limited research documents the effects of light from digital media on sleep, the results are particularly applicable to youth, who may be more sensitive to light than adults.86 One study 87 found that the magnitude of melatonin suppression induced by moderately bright indoor light levels in the evening was twice as much in primary school children as in adults. This difference could be related to pupil diameter, which is significantly larger in children than adults. Another study88 found that children showed significantly greater melatonin suppression compared to adolescents in response to varying degrees of evening light exposure. Taken together, these results suggest that the light from screen media use around bedtime adversely affects sleep, particularly in younger children. Furthermore, these findings indicate the need for further research on the effect of screen media devices on sleep, especially in youth.\n\nInternet and video game addiction and sleep\n\nThere is growing concern that technology habits can become uncontrollable and excessive to the point of interference with normal daily functioning. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V (DSM-V) recognizes one type of technology addiction, internet gaming disorder, as a “condition for further study”.89 More broadly, the concept of internet and video game addiction (IVGA), has gained traction in the psychological and psychiatric communities, due in part to the disorder’s deleterious effects on sleep. IVGA is classified as an inability of internet users to limit excessive internet use, with ensuing psychosocial dysfunction.90 A recent systematic literature review and other studies show a particularly strong association between use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and poor sleep quality.91–93 IVGA has been associated with subjective insomnia and insufficient sleep among afflicted adolescents.91 Existing literature on this association remains limited and causality is unproven, but there appears to be a strong association between IVGA and sleep problems.\n\nModerating factors\n\nNew evidence suggests some young people are particularly susceptible to the ill effects of screen media on sleep quality. As early as 2009, researchers documented individual differences in teenagers’ heart rate variability (HRV) when playing violent video games.83 A subsequent study46 demonstrated that adolescents’ level of gaming experience moderated the effect between their videogame use, HRV, and sleep. Inexperienced gamers reported poorer sleep after playing a violent video game, in contrast to experienced gamers who reported poorer sleep after a nonviolent videogame. Physiological trait differences can also amplify technology exposure effects by directly delaying bedtimes.52 An experimental laboratory study by Reynolds and colleagues79 revealed that adolescents who perceived fewer consequences from risk-taking were more likely to end daily video gaming sessions at a later time, thus delaying sleep onset, compared with their peers. Smith et al.94 found that adolescents who self-reported higher trait flow (the ability to easily immerse oneself into an activity) were also more likely to delay bedtime via extended periods of evening gaming. Their follow-up laboratory study replicated this effect, but only for videogames that were both challenging and enjoyable (i.e. when game difficulty was set to “hard” instead of “easy”). Similarly, poor self-control in combination with unstructured television viewing has been associated with delayed bedtimes in adults, a finding supported in a follow-up study.95 This emerging research suggests that identifying predisposing individual traits and characteristics of the technology use helps discern youth whose technology habits are most likely to delay sleep onset.\n\nInterventions, policies and strategies designed to improve child and adolescent sleep\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a Statement of Endorsement in support of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines, which recommends that screen-based devices not be allowed in children’s bedrooms and be turned off 30 minutes before bedtime.96 These are commonly suggested approaches, but modifying media content may be another effective means of protecting sleep. A randomized trial found that a harm-reduction intervention, which attempted to change the media exposure of preschool children away from violent and towards educational and prosocial content, significantly decreased odds of sleep problems across follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 months, compared with controls.97\n\nExperimental studies seeking to evaluate interventions to improve sleep outcomes in children and adolescents are sparse, and have typically incorporated multifaceted sleep hygiene programs that address multiple elements in addition to screen media before bed. Nevertheless, existing literature suggests that limiting screen time during the 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime may yield modest benefits in terms of “lights out time” as well as sleep quality and duration. A one-week program, consisting of classes teaching sleep physiology, biological significance, and consequences of sleep deprivation, resulted in more regular bedtimes and shorter sleep-onset latency among 58 adolescents (mean 16 years old), but no benefit on sleep quality or daytime sleepiness.98 Another investigation assessed the utility the FERRET (Food, Emotions, Routine, Restrict, Environment and Timing) sleep hygiene program among 22 adolescents (mean 13 years old). FERRET instructed adolescents to comply with three rules for each of the domains of the acronym (e.g. Restrict: No electronic media at least 30 minutes before bed, no exercise 3 hours before bed, no other activities in bed except for sleep).99 This program significantly improved scores on the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), although objective sleep duration did not change significantly. A targeted intervention of mobile phone restriction in the hour before bed among 63 adolescents (mean 16 years old) resulted in “lights out” 17 minutes earlier and a total sleep time increase of 19 minutes per night.100 However, the authors reported a low 26% recruitment rate, highlighting the difficulty of implementing such a regimented screen-limiting schedule in teens. In another study, limiting screen media around bedtime for healthy adolescents with good sleep did not significantly impact sleep outcomes. In a study of high school athletes (mean 17 years) whose baseline consisted of sufficient sleep (e.g. total sleep time, 7:49 weekdays, 9:11 weekends), a strict “no electronic media” rule after 10:00 pm resulted in no benefit in terms of total sleep time, sleep quality, or daytime functioning.101 In sum, limited existing research suggests that sleep hygiene interventions may be practically challenging to achieve but yield benefits to those children and adolescents with insufficent sleep. Larger, multi-site studies are urgently needed given the increasing intrusion of evening screen media use in of the lives of modern youth, including gaming, social media, and homework.\n\nClinician’s perspective\n\nClinicians can help families improve their sleep health and screen media habits by encouraging parenting marked by high levels of warmth and support, as well as limits that are clearly communicated, consistently applied appropriate to the child’s behavior and context, and allow for developmentally appropriate autonomy(i.e. an authoritative parenting style). 102,103 (See Box 1) All parents should begin instilling family bedtime routines and healthy sleep habits early in life, and adjust these routines as youth mature (See Box 2). If the youth health behaviors and habits become part of the child’s own daily routine, she will be better able to take charge of her own sleep health behaviors when this becomes appropriate in later years. For younger children, these routines mean establishing household rules related to screens and sleep early on. For older children and adolescents, they involve open conversation about the core reasons for behaviors. This proactive and engaged parenting style promotes cooperation and parent-child shared goals for children’s health and well-being, and aims to help children develop self-regulation skills, and eventually increasing autonomy to govern their own behavior.\n\nBox 1.

Sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for parents.\n\nEstablish screen media habits for your children which enable healthy sleep.3,7,113\n\nPlan a bedtime that allows for adequate sleep.\n\nAvoid screen media in the hour before bedtime and at nighttime.\n\nReplace evening screen time with calm activities for your children (reading, coloring, conversation, etc.).\n\nKeep all screen devices (TVs, video games, computers, tablets, and smartphones) out of bedrooms.\n\nAvoid passive background media: Children may be affected by screen media even when they are not actively engaged.\n\nContent matters: Avoid violent and/or scary media, which can negatively affect your children’s sleep.\n\nFamily rules/routines are most effective when applied to all children in the household.\n\nEstablish other healthy sleep practices for your child and yourself.112,114,115\n\nSet and abide by regular bedtimes every day, including weekends, allowing the child sufficient sleep duration for his/her age.10\n\nBedtime should follow a predictable routine (e.g.: brush teeth, read a story, lights out).\n\nBedrooms should be cool (65–70 degrees), comfortable, dark, and quiet.\n\nAvoid evening intake of chocolate or beverages that interfere with sleep (soda, tea, coffee, energy drinks).\n\nInclude physical exercise into the daily routine, and spend time outdoors during sunlight hours when possible.\n\nBe a healthy sleep role model by prioritizing your own sleep.\n\nImprove your own sleep-related behaviors (e.g., reduce screen time before bedtime, establish a regular bedtime, etc.)114 to improve your health and well-being116\n\nTurn off electronic media devices in the evening throughout the household and charge all mobile devices in a central location outside bedrooms.\n\nParents who are overtired are less well able to parent effectively, including being proactive in orchestrating child routines and dealing effectively and calmly with daily hassles that are part of everyday life.\n\nParent your child with clear communication, awareness, and fair, consistent, developmentally appropriate rules.117\n\nTalk with your child or teen early and often about the importance of adequate sleep for optimal health.\n\nBe aware of how much time your child or teen spends engaging in screen media, including before and after bedtime.76\n\nPay attention to your child or teen’s mood and behavior at home, and discuss concerns you may have. Mood impairment is often caused by inadequate sleep.\n\nEstablish and enforce appropriate media and sleep rules for your children as early in their lives as possible; consistently point out after-effects of failing to follow those rules (e.g., being tired and cranky the next day after playing games too late) to develop your child’s understanding of the effects of inadequate sleep.\n\nWork with teens to jointly develop healthy sleep routines that also allow them to meet obligations (e.g., homework or sports) and are consistent with the guidelines above. Developing autonomy and ability to self-regulate is important for teens, as is consistency.\n\nExamples from health psychology provide accessible guidance. A teen with a healthy diet does not typically result from the rigid imposition of a such a diet after a lifetime of unhealthy foods, but with a healthy and balanced eating habits instilled from a young age. A healthy “screen media diet” may be a resonant and useful concept for many children, parents, educators, and clinicians. It is difficult for parents who smoke to mandate a no-smoking policy. Role modeling and a health-risk prevention approach is far more likely to be effective than a secondary prevention approach (e.g smoking cessation). Successful parenting ideally starts early and sets appropriate norms and boundaries while maintaining parental warmth, rather than holding off on setting boundaries until a problem develops requiring discipline. Encouraging the development of age-appropriate autonomy will help teenagers to develop a sense of responsibility for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nFor teenagers presenting with excessive screen time, a few clinical pearls may help families to follow the recommendations laid out in Box 1 and 2, below. First, one must always focus on the chief complaint, what brought the patient to seek help in the first place. In cases of excessive nighttime screen media use, children and adolescents are often seen in the clinician’s office for poor academic performance or lack of concentration in school. Upon taking a careful history, the clinician often discovers a significant lack of sleep, often attributable to patients staying up late while using mobile devices, computers, or videogames. Clinicians must discover the underlying factors (e.g., social or family stress) which drive the patient to use the screens in the late hours. Addressing such factors directly may be essential to motivating families to achieve healthier screen habits.\n\nThe clinicians should then work with families to reduce evening and nighttime screen media use via structural and behavioral modifications in order to improve sleep health (See Box 2). Many adolescents are reluctant to change their health behaviors,104 yet providing them with education about the positive benefits of sufficient sleep as well as the negative consequences of poor sleep can help motivate such change.105–109 For example, pointing out that a change in sleep habits may improve concentration, daytime alertness, and academic performance may motivate youth to modify nighttime habits. Discussing the negative repercussions of inadequate sleep on qualities that are important to the patient, such as body weight or athletic performance, may likewise motivate the patient to reduce nighttime screen media use and establish other healthy bedtime habits. Perhaps most importantly, parents and children should remove screen-based devices from the bedroom to ensure that they are not used at night.\n\nChanging bedtime screen media use habits in our young patients is challenging. However, several tools and strategies increase our chances of success, with the goal of promoting healthy sleep habits that children and adolescents will continue to follow throughout their lives.\n\nRecommendations for clinicians, educators, and parents\n\nBased on our current understanding of clinical practice and sleep health research, we have developed sleep-friendly screen-behavior recommendations for clinicians and educators (see Box 1) and for parents (see Box 2) to help minimize the adverse effects of screen-based media on the sleep of children and adolescents.\n\nFuture directions\n\nResearch indicates that screen-based media represents a threat to the sleep quality of youth, many of whom already have insufficient sleep. However, very few studies demonstrate easy-to-implement and effective interventions. Future research should develop, implement, and evaluate sustainable interventions that minimize the adverse effects of evening screen use on sleep. For example, a means of reducing fear of missing out from social media and other screen-based activities may significantly improve the sleep of adolescents.110,111 There is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research into the effects of screen-based media on sleep and related health consequences among children and adolescents, in order to educate and motivate parents, clinicians, teachers, and youth to foster healthy sleep habits.\n\nKey points.\n\nUse of screen media by youth, throughout the day and in the period before bedtime, is associated with shorter total sleep time and delayed sleep onset in over five dozen studies from around the world. Access to a screen-media device in the bedroom at night is associated with shorter sleep duration, later bedtime, and poorer sleep quality.\n\nThe currently-supported mechanisms underlying the relationship between screen media habits and sleep outcomes include (1) displacement of time spent sleeping by time spent using screens, (2) psychological stimulation from screen-media content, and (3) alerting and circadian effects of exposure to light from screens.\n\nClinicians, educators, and parents should prioritize the need of youth to get sufficient sleep through maintaining regular and consistent bedtime routines. In addition, youth and parents should practice sleep-friendly screen behaviors: restricting exposure to digital media in the hour before bedtime, turning devices off during the night, and keeping devices out of bedrooms. Modifying media content to reduce psychological stimulation (e.g., limiting violent or scary media) may also reduce adverse impact on sleep.\n\nThere is a clear need for more basic, translational, and clinical research examining the effects of screen media on sleep and related health and health behavior consequences among children and adolescents in order to educate and motivate clinicians, teachers, parents and youth to maintain healthy sleep habits.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to Guest Editor, Paul Weigle, MD for his careful review and constructive feedback on this manuscript.\n\nFootnotes\n\nDisclosures: Authors on this paper were in part supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R01HD073352 (supporting Dr. Hale, Dr. Chang, G.

Abstract

(1) Background: Sleep is considered to be a complex condition for human beings, with the aim of ensuring physical and psychological recovery. Technology, including the cell phone, is a tool for teenagers that ensures they are always available to interact, even at night. This study aims to understand the influence of the use of smartphones on adolescent sleep quality. (2) Methods: The guidelines proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed. The search was conducted in October 2022 through the EBSCOhost platform, with access to the CINAHL Complete and Medline databases and through the b-On database. (3) Results: The use of electronic equipment plays an important role in adolescents’ lives. There is a negative relationship between the use of electronic equipment, such as smartphones, and sleep, for reducing both the quality and quantity of sleep. There is also a relationship between nighttime smartphone use, insufficient sleep, and mental health problems. (4) Conclusions: The use of new technologies at night causes a change in the behavior of adolescents with repercussions in terms of the quality of sleep and sleep duration and consequent well-being and performance during the day.

Keywords: smartphone, children, well-being, sleep, teenagers, media

1. Introduction

Sleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].

In a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).

The circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].

As it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.

The World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.

For good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.

Nowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].

This permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).

The Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.

Considering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.

2. Materials and Methods

A Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).

Using the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”

The search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.

The articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.

Among the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.

All articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.

Regarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.

All studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.

The analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].

Johansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.

In fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

4. Discussion

Adolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].

Technological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].

Schweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.

Tavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.

The constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.

If, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.

The high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.

In fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.

The studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.

Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.

According to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].

Many authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.

Lemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.

In Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).

Meeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).

This study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.

Therefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.

Nursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).

Johansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].

In this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].

It is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.

5. Conclusions

It was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.

The influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.

It becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.

Based on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.

6. Limitations/Future Prospects

Limitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.

Introduction\n\nSleep is considered to be a very complex condition that serves to restructure all functions of an organism and to ensure the physical and psychic recovery of human beings. It is believed that during the sleep period, cell renewal, production of hormones and antibodies, protein synthesis, and metabolic regulation take place, which contribute in a very significant way to the physical growth of children [1].\n\nIn a questionnaire conducted in 2018 in Portugal regarding the sleep of Portuguese adolescents, it was concluded that 86.3% (N = 3894) reported difficulty in waking up in the morning and 59.7% (N = 3899) believed they sleep poorly [2]. Throughout growth, the sleep pattern undergoes changes, given that in adolescence, there is a shift in sleep patterns associated with deep changes that occur at a biological, psychological, and sociocultural level. As Bartel affirms: “The decline in adolescent sleep quantity and quality is multifactorial, and is influenced by biological, environmental, societal, and behavioral facts” [2] (p. 498).\n\nThe circadian rhythm of adolescents is bound to the inherent alterations in this growth stage. The sleep–wake cycle is regulated by melatonin, the hormone responsible for the onset of sleep, beginning its production at dusk. In adolescence, the production of this hormone occurs later, which implies that the adolescent will feel sleepy later and this sensation will last until later, coinciding with the waking hour [3].\n\nAs it is expected that changes inherent to this stage of growth will occur in adolescents’ sleep patterns, it is important to take into consideration that “Adolescence is a sensitive age period for changes in sleep-wake patterns” [4] (p. 277) and that the National Sleep Foundation [5] recommends that an adolescent should sleep between 8 and 10 h. It is also proven that the quantity of sleep hours is not always associated with quality sleep.\n\nThe World Sleep Society [6] refers to the existence of studies suggesting that the quality of sleep holds a bigger impact than its quantity, both in terms of quality of life and daily period, such that poor-quality sleep combined with precarious health are closely related to a decrease in quality of life and happiness. The World Sleep Society highlights, in turn, that sleep centers around the world invite the teaching of good “sleep hygiene,” advocating for the conservation of high-quality sleep in sufficient quantity. It also emphasizes that sleep is a basic human necessity as important as eating and drinking and indispensable for health and well-being. Good sleep along with a balanced diet and adequate physical exercise are important factors and some of the pillars of health. Finally, it states that sleep problems represent a global pandemic that puts at risk the health and quality of life of approximately 45% of the world’s population, and in this sense, an adequate understanding of this problem will help to reduce the impact of sleep disturbances on society.\n\nFor good-quality sleep, three elements are considered: duration, continuity, and depth [6]. The World Sleep Society [6], through the document “Ten commandments for better sleep”, which was released in the 2016 to celebrate the World Sleep Day, reveals the essential rules of proper sleep hygiene to maintain or restore deep, healthy, restful, and natural sleep, and underlines environmental conditions and the usage of electronic devices as a set of factors that influence the quantity and quality of sleep and, consequently, general well-being, which depends on high-quality sleep.\n\nNowadays, technology is constantly present in our life, and smartphones provide constant opportunities to connect with others [3], creating the need to be frequently connectable and connected to various social and sharing networks. This need is also felt among adolescents, who have, in technology, a tool that makes them always available for interaction [3]. This leads to a delay in the onset of sleep, as well as its frequent interruption through new technologies, namely the smartphone, as they coexist with the presence of noise and several standby lights, which disturb sleep [7].\n\nThis permanent connectivity that technological devices allow for increasingly presents itself as a risk factor for good-quality sleep among adolescents. Various studies confirm that “Sleep disturbance and adverse health outcomes related to screen media practices are on the rise affecting physical, cognitive, and behavioral health out-comes” [8] (p. 292).\n\nThe Portuguese Association of Sleep [7] demonstrates that, in Portugal, children and adolescents sleep, in general, for less time than is recommended, linking changes in the lifestyles of parents and children with alterations in sleep habit patterns.\n\nConsidering this topic as a current issue, since the quality of sleep is of extreme importance for good physical and intellectual development of adolescents, it was determined that this topic is of the utmost importance. The following question was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?” Therefore, the objective of this review is to understand how the use of smartphones interferes with the quality of adolescents’ sleep.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nA Systematic Literature Review was performed, based on the methodological procedures defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, and it was registered on PROSPERO platform (registration number CRD42023395696).\n\nUsing the PICO method (P—problem/population/participants (adolescents); I—intervention (use of smartphones); C—comparison/context (society); O—outcomes, results (influence in sleep)), the question for this review was formulated: “Does the use of smartphones affect adolescents’ sleep?”\n\nThe search of articles was carried out on the platform EBSCOhost, with access to the databases CINAHL Complete and Medline, also on the database b-ON, following the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) [9]. As keywords, the words “smartphone”, “children”, “well-being”, “sleep”, “teenagers”, and “media” were selected, using the operator Boolean “AND” to combine the search terms. The research was conducted in October 2022 by two researchers simultaneously, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third researcher participated in the selection of studies for final review, confirming the selection and exclusion criteria, after individual reviews and researchers’ meetings. For this review, inclusion criteria were defined: randomized controlled studies, experimental studies without randomization, cohort studies and controlled cases, observational studies without group control, case series and clinical trials, with published full text, with relevance to the identified problem, written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and with publication date between 2014 and 2022. The review considered studies that included adolescents, according to the definitions of American Academy of Pediatrics, which considers all individuals from 11 to 21 years old.\n\nThe articles whose topic was not relevant for the review in question were excluded, and those that did not address the previously defined population and Systematic Literature Reviews.\n\nAmong the databases used, in total, 140 were obtained. The relevance of these articles was analyzed by reading the title, summary, and, whenever necessary, full-text reading. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 articles were selected, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\n\nPRISMA of study selection and inclusion process [10].\n\nAfter the selection of studies, they were evaluated critically by applying assessment grids of the level of evidence, reliability, and relevance, which allowed us to classify the studies found (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.\n\nCritical evaluation of the results of the included studies according to the critical evaluation verification list by Joanna Briggs Institute [11].\n\nArticles\tQ1\tQ2\tQ3\tQ4\tQ5\tQ6\tQ7\tQ8\tQ9\tQ10\tResult\nTavernier et al.

One month after, the students were visited a second time and completed the same questionnaire.\nOpen in a new tab\n\nAll articles selected in this Systematic Literature Review are studies published between 2014 and 2018, as journal articles, with five of these articles being observational descriptive studies and one article being a quasi-experimental study. They carefully present their aims, where they took place, the methods used, and their participants.\n\nRegarding the place where the studies were performed, two were performed in the United States of America (USA), two in Switzerland, one in Sweden, and one in Australia.\n\nAll studies considered participants who were attending high school, so the results of different articles were obtained through self-report analysis of the adolescents, namely through interview. One of the articles analyzed [4] associated this method with an evaluation of sleep behavior using a motor activity recording device during sleep.\n\nThe analyzed studies evaluate, in general, the relation between the use of electronic devices and adolescents’ sleep, with special emphasis on the use of smartphones in five of these articles [3,12,13,14,15].\n\nJohansson et al. [3] reported that about 47% of the respondents used three or four devices before going to bed, and 97% used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime, in particular, the mobile phone (used by nearly 74% of respondents). They also concluded that the number of devices used before bedtime would be associated with reports of waking up too early and restless sleep, with repercussions in daytime sleepiness.\n\nIn fact, the use of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, is highlighted by several authors. Schweizer et al. [12] verified that smartphone owners were more likely to experience sleep problems than non-smartphone owners, who usually sleep the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than what is recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that having a smartphone would be related to a greater use of electronic devices and, in particular, their use in bed, before sleep, by watching videos, phone calling, and texting with friends. The use of these electronic devices in bed before sleep was associated with less sleep time and difficulty in sleeping, such as being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night, which would intensify these changes.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual texting and working on the computer, and even that more time using the computer was associated with less sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep; that is, when adolescents spend more time interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nLikewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating sending and receiving messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that tiredness during the day was frequently associated with this. Like these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and a decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that the nighttime use of the phone would is also associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAdolescence is a period of great physical, emotional, and social changes, in which sleep is susceptible to modification inherent to these changes. Variations in bedtime hour, waking hour, and sleep habits are very common among adolescents, with sleep disorders considered a public health problem in the United States of America, Europe, and Asian countries [13].\n\nTechnological development has been growing exponentially in the last few decades and, consequently, the use of electronic devices now plays an important role in adolescents’ lives [13,14]. With the current systematic literature review, it was intended to understand the relation between the use of new technologies, particularly smartphones, and the sleep of adolescents. The studies analyzed corroborate the existing literature, reinforcing the fact that the use of technological gadgets influences the sleep of adolescents [3,4,12,13,14,15]. Among electronic devices, the smartphone stands out for its use, disseminated especially among adolescents, its ease of access, and its functionalities [12,14].\n\nSchweizer et al. [11] verified that the owners of a smartphone were more prone to having sleep problems than non-owners, who slept, on average, for the number of hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation. They observed that as soon as the adolescents owned a smartphone, they would start to sleep less than recommended, increasing the prevalence of sleep problems to achieve the prevalence observed among owners. The authors state that smartphones enable Internet access anywhere at any time, in addition to allowing communication through texts messages and free phone calls, which justifies the increase in possession of smartphones among adolescents.\n\nTavernier et al. [4] verified that adolescents sleep less when they spend more time than usual using electronic-based devices, such as texting and working on a computer, and, furthermore, more time using a computer was associated with reduced sleep efficiency. On the contrary, they verified a positive association between the time spent in direct social contact (with friends and family) and the efficiency and latency of sleep, meaning when adolescents spend more time than usual interacting directly with friends/family, they fall asleep faster.\n\nThe constant connectivity in technological devices has been a risk factor for good-quality adolescent sleep, as already confirmed in the literature [16]. The elevated quantity of time spent by adolescents with technological-based activities is undeniable, usage that is also verified at nighttime, namely the hour before bedtime, so several studies have focused on its use in this period. Lemola et al. [15] concluded that the possession of a smartphone would be related to a generally greater use of electronic devices, and, in particular, the use in bed, before sleep, watching videos, for phone calls, or texting friends.\n\nIf, on the one hand, the screen time stands out, on the other hand, there seems to be an association between owning a smartphone and the use of electronic devices at night.\n\nThe high amount of time spent by adolescents on technology-based activities is undeniable, with studies suggesting that this directly influences sleep time and efficiency.\n\nIn fact, Johansson et al. [3] verified that 97% of adolescents used some type of technology in the hour before bedtime (especially the mobile phone, used by nearly 74% of respondents). Further, 47% of the respondents used three or four devices in this time period. Vernon et al. [14] also corroborated this idea by concluding that there were few adolescents that did not use the mobile phone during nighttime after switching off the lights to sleep.\n\nThe studies reviewed suggest that there is a relationship between screen time and sleep, especially when used at night. Johansson et al. [3] verified the existence of a direct relation between the use of electronic devices and the sleep changes in adolescents, with its use before bedtime being associated with reports of waking up too early, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness. This association was also verified by Vernon et al. [14] and by Lemola et al. [15], who highlighted that being online in bed and with the phone turned on at night would exacerbate these changes. Likewise, Garmy and Ward [13] highlighted the nighttime use of mobile phones, associating the sending and receiving of messages at night with much later hours to fall asleep, less regular hours to fall asleep, shorter times in bed, and irregular sleep habits. The authors also verified that frequently associated with this, there would be tiredness during the day.\n\nLike these authors, Vernon et al. [14] also established a significative correlation between the nighttime use of phones and bad sleep behavior.\n\nAccording to the literature, this influence can be explained, on the one hand, by the cognitive, emotional, and physiological excitement associated with social interactions and videogaming at night and, on the other, by the light exposure emitted by screens, which can suppress the secretions of melatonin, contributing equally to difficulties in falling asleep [3,13,14].\n\nMany authors established the relation between sleep problems associated with the use of new technologies and the well-being and psychosocial behavior of adolescents. Vernon et al. [14] established a significative correlation among nighttime use of phones, bad sleep behavior, and the decline in adolescents’ well-being. The authors verified that nighttime use of the phone would also be associated with depressive humor, low self-esteem, externalizing behavior, and low coping ability.\n\nLemola et al. [15] also concluded that the use of smartphones may be a partial mediator of the relation between the use of these electronic devices at night and depressive symptoms. They also established a relation regarding sleep, depressive symptoms, and the use of electronic devices before sleep, which meets the existing literature on the subject: “Recent studies show a link between insufficient sleep and mental health problems, including anxiety depression, low self-esteem and suicidality”; at the same time, it has negative effects on academic performance and overall performance during the day [13] (p.123). This phenomenon seems to occur, according to the author, because adolescents manifest feelings of concern and disconnection when unable to access technology, fearing the loss of information or important messages.\n\nIn Portugal, in 2017, a study was conducted about epidemiology of internet use in a population of adolescents and its relationship with sleep habits, published in Portuguese Medical minutes [17], in which 722 adolescents were inquired for establishing a parallel between use of the internet and, consequentially, the associated technology (mobile phones, online gaming devices, computers, tablets) and sleep habits. The study was based on the premise that the adolescents’ use of internet and its excessive use were associated with dysfunctional coping strategies and worsen interpersonal relationships, negative impact on psychosocial development of adolescents, its association with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), depression, and anxiety. Therefore, the authors intended to “measure and characterize the use of internet in adolescence; determine the internet dependence on adolescence; evaluate the association between internet dependency and sleep changes/excessive daytime tiredness” [17] (p. 52).\n\nMeeting the results of the findings in the present review, the study revealed that the internet dependence and its problematic use could have a significant influence on the sleep–wake cycle associated with intermediate insomnia, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive daytime tiredness, which was mentioned by Garmy and Ward [13]. It also tried to explain that the “negative impact of excessive internet use and sleep habits could be due to the use of devices (computer/mobile phone/tablet) while falling asleep, which conditions a state of excitement, therefore, interfering with the necessary procedures of a normal sleep-wake cycle” [17] (p. 531).\n\nThis study was the only one found about this topic for this age group in Portugal; it supports the analyzed studies of the present systematic literature review.\n\nTherefore, although the mobile phone is a tool for social interaction that cultivates self-esteem, autonomy, and identity in adolescents, its excessive use, notably at night-time, constitutes a problem, with an impact on the health of adolescents [14]. Thus, the parents/caregivers and the current policies have a preponderant role in the sensibilization of adolescents regarding the disadvantages of nighttime use of technologies/use of mobile phones in the sleep quality of adolescents.\n\nNursing has a privileged position in the contact with adolescents and families in their daily practice. Therefore, according to Garmy and Ward [13], nurses are in an ideal position to educate adolescents about the importance of healthy and consistent sleep habits and to alert them to the hazards of bad or insufficient sleep habits. According to the same authors, more than the adolescents, “School nurses are also in a unique position to discuss sleep health and educate not only students but also teachers and parents.” (p. 124).\n\nJohansson et al. [3] also considered that the results of the study have implications for nursing care practices: “Nurses are in the ideal position to address their goal by educating adolescents, their families, and the broader community about good sleep hygiene” (p. 502). The author also reinforces the importance of nurses in primary health care, as “Nurses in primary care or outpatient clinics should inquire about an adolescent’s sleep habits, sleep quality, and technology use before bed. In addition, nurses should take the opportunity to counsel families in healthy sleep habits.” (p. 502), meeting what was previously stated by Garmy and Ward [13].\n\nIn this sense, measures were suggested that are focused on the healthy use of technology in the beginning of adolescence, informing the adolescents and their parents that the acquisition of smartphone or other electronic devices can bring consequences regarding sleep quality, which repercuss in the adolescent’s quality of life [3,13].\n\nIt is urgent to alert and study, alongside parents, strategies that limit the use of electronic devices, mainly during the nighttime period as a way of promoting quality sleep.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIt was possible to find evidence that confirms the influence of technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, in the sleep of adolescents. The results of the present systematic literature review suggest that this influence may be mainly associated with screen time. More studies are needed that explore the relation between adolescent sleep and screen time, even during the day.\n\nThe influence of technology, highlighting the use of smartphones, repercusses both in terms of quality and sleep duration, with manifestations in the performance of adolescents during the day and their well-being.\n\nIt becomes urgent to promote the implementation of measures that encourage a healthy use of new technologies, specifically at night.\n\nBased on scientific assumptions, the nurse, in collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team, alongside adolescents, parents, and educators, could develop interventions that promote the thoughtful use of these resources, as this approach should be developed in the follow-up appointments of infant and juvenile health. Despite the present systematic literature review focusing on adolescents, the approach towards a healthy education for the use of this resource should be initiated as soon as possible.\n\n6. Limitations/Future Prospects\n\nLimitations were identified in some of the studies found, especially regarding the age of the study participants, which is not consensual, and it is not always identified for the authors to present only the year of schooling. Some of the results were also based on adolescents’ self-report and, in some cases, obtained through questionnaires conducted in class, which may condition the adolescents’ answers and their veracity. In the future, research will be needed that considers all these factors.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.d.C.M. and M.C.; methodology, S.d.S., A.B. and M.C.; software, M.J.R. and H.M.; validation, H.M., S.D. and M.J.R.; formal analysis, S.d.S.; investigation, M.J.R. and S.D.; resources, S.d.S. and A.B.; data curation, M.d.C.M.; writing—original draft preparation, S.d.S. and A.B.; writing—review and editing, M.J.R.; visualization, S.D.; supervision, M.C.; project administration, S.d.S. and M.d.C.M.

### Report on the Effects of Smartphone Usage on Teenagers' Sleep Quality and Academic Performance

#### Introduction
The systematic literature review titled "The Influence of Smartphones on Adolescent Sleep" explores the impact of smartphone usage on the sleep quality of adolescents and its subsequent effects on their daily performance and well-being. The study is grounded in the understanding that sleep is a critical component for the physical and psychological recovery of human beings, particularly during adolescence—a period marked by significant biological, psychological, and sociocultural changes.

#### Methodology
The review followed the guidelines proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and utilized databases such as CINAHL Complete, Medline, and b-On to gather relevant literature. The search was conducted in October 2022, focusing on studies published between 2014 and 2022. The review included randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and observational studies involving adolescents aged 11 to 21 years.

#### Key Findings
1. **Impact on Sleep Quality and Duration**: The review found a negative relationship between smartphone usage and sleep quality and quantity among adolescents. Nighttime use of smartphones was associated with insufficient sleep and mental health issues. The presence of electronic devices, particularly smartphones, in the bedroom led to delayed sleep onset and frequent sleep interruptions.

2. **Behavioral and Health Outcomes**: The studies reviewed indicated that excessive screen time, especially before bedtime, contributed to sleep disturbances, which in turn affected adolescents' physical, cognitive, and behavioral health. The use of smartphones at night was linked to depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and poor coping abilities.

3. **Academic Performance**: Although the review primarily focused on sleep quality, it highlighted that poor sleep due to smartphone usage could negatively impact academic performance. Insufficient and poor-quality sleep were associated with decreased alertness and cognitive function, which are critical for academic success.

4. **Role of Technology**: The review emphasized the pervasive role of technology in adolescents' lives, noting that smartphones provide constant connectivity, which can be a risk factor for sleep quality. The light emitted by screens can suppress melatonin production, further delaying sleep onset.

5. **Recommendations for Intervention**: The review suggested that promoting good sleep hygiene and limiting nighttime use of electronic devices could improve sleep quality. It also highlighted the role of parents, educators, and healthcare professionals in educating adolescents about the importance of healthy sleep habits.

#### Conclusion
The systematic literature review provides substantial evidence that smartphone usage negatively affects adolescents' sleep quality and duration, with potential repercussions on their mental health and academic performance. It underscores the need for interventions that promote healthy technology use and sleep hygiene to mitigate these effects.

#### Implications for Future Research
The review calls for further studies to explore the relationship between screen time and sleep quality, particularly during the day, and to develop strategies that limit nighttime use of electronic devices. It also suggests that future research should consider the broader psychosocial impacts of smartphone usage on adolescents.

#### Limitations
The review acknowledges limitations in the age range of study participants and the reliance on self-reported data, which may affect the accuracy of the findings. Future research should address these limitations to provide more comprehensive insights into the impact of smartphone usage on adolescent sleep and academic performance.

The provided text is highly relevant to the question regarding the effects of smartphone usage on teenagers' sleep quality and its impact on their academic performance. The text is a comprehensive review that explores the relationship between smartphone use, sleep disturbances, and academic outcomes in adolescents. Here is a structured report based on the information from the text:

### Effects of Smartphone Usage on Teenagers' Sleep Quality

1. **Disruption of Circadian Rhythms**: The use of smartphones, particularly the exposure to blue light emitted by screens, can disrupt circadian rhythms. This disruption is due to the suppression of melatonin secretion, which delays sleep onset and reduces sleep efficiency. The text highlights that the blue light from smartphones is particularly effective at altering circadian rhythms, leading to later bedtimes and shorter sleep durations.

2. **Sleep Displacement**: Smartphones are often used as unstructured leisure activities, which can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use does not have a clear endpoint, which can result in prolonged usage and delayed sleep.

3. **Content-Induced Arousal**: The type of content consumed on smartphones, such as activating music, arousing images, or engaging video games, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset. This can lead to reduced sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness.

4. **Sleep Quality and Duration**: Studies cited in the text indicate that smartphone usage is associated with shorter sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness. These effects are particularly pronounced when smartphones are used at bedtime.

### Impact on Academic Performance

1. **Cognitive and Academic Impairment**: Sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and learning. The text emphasizes that sleep deprivation due to smartphone use can impair cognitive functions, leading to subpar academic performance. This is supported by epidemiological studies that demonstrate a consistent relationship between sleep quality and academic outcomes.

2. **Mental Health and Learning**: The review highlights that chronic sleep deprivation from excessive smartphone use can lead to reduced cognitive ability, social isolation, and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. These factors can further impair academic performance.

3. **Public Health Recommendations**: The text suggests that restricting smartphone use before bedtime can improve sleep quality and, consequently, academic performance. It also mentions that screen time guidelines recommend limiting smartphone use to no more than two hours per day for adolescents.

### Conclusion

The review underscores the negative impact of smartphone usage on adolescents' sleep quality and academic performance. It calls for public health interventions to impose screen time restrictions and educate students about the importance of sleep for academic success. The findings suggest that reducing smartphone use, particularly before bedtime, can have significant benefits for sleep health and learning outcomes in teenagers.

### Report on Restricting Smartphone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools

#### Introduction
The text from the "Reference Information" section provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between screen media use and sleep among children and adolescents. It highlights the adverse effects of screen time, particularly before bedtime, on sleep quality and duration. This report will explore how restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools might improve teenagers' sleep quality and academic performance.

#### Impact of Screen Media on Sleep
The widespread use of portable electronic devices, including smartphones, has been associated with insufficient sleep among adolescents.

This report delves into the documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers\' sleep and academic outcomes, and explores how restricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools might improve these outcomes. The analysis is based on a systematic literature review titled "The Influence of Smartphones on Adolescent Sleep," which provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between smartphone use, sleep disturbances, and academic performance in adolescents.\n\n## Effects of Smartphone Usage on Teenagers\' Sleep Quality\n\n### Disruption of Circadian Rhythms\n\nSmartphone usage, particularly at night, has been shown to disrupt adolescents\' circadian rhythms. The blue light emitted by smartphone screens is a significant factor in this disruption. It suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles, leading to delayed sleep onset and reduced sleep efficiency (Cajochen et al., 2011). This disruption is particularly concerning during adolescence, a period characterized by natural shifts in circadian rhythms that already predispose teenagers to later sleep times (Crowley et al., 2018).\n\n### Sleep Displacement\n\nSmartphones often serve as a source of unstructured leisure activities, which can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities with clear endpoints, smartphone use can extend indefinitely, resulting in prolonged usage and delayed sleep (Cain & Gradisar, 2010). This displacement of sleep time is exacerbated by the engaging nature of smartphone content, which can include social media, games, and videos.\n\n### Content-Induced Arousal\n\nThe type of content consumed on smartphones can also impact sleep quality. Engaging or stimulating content, such as activating music, arousing images, or interactive video games, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset (Hale & Guan, 2015). This heightened state of arousal can lead to reduced sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness, further affecting adolescents\' daily functioning.\n\n### Sleep Quality and Duration\n\nNumerous studies have documented the negative impact of smartphone usage on sleep quality and duration. A systematic review by Carter et al. (2016) found that 90% of studies reported a significant association between screen media use and delayed bedtime or decreased total sleep time. Adolescents who use smartphones at night often experience shorter sleep durations, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness, all of which can have detrimental effects on their overall well-being.\n\n## Impact on Academic Performance\n\n### Cognitive and Academic Impairment\n\nSleep plays a crucial role in cognitive processes such as memory consolidation and learning. Sleep deprivation due to smartphone use can impair these cognitive functions, leading to subpar academic performance (Curcio et al., 2006). Studies have consistently demonstrated a relationship between poor sleep quality and decreased academic outcomes, with sleep-deprived students showing reduced attention, memory, and problem-solving abilities (Dewald et al., 2010).\n\n### Mental Health and Learning\n\nChronic sleep deprivation from excessive smartphone use can also impact mental health, further impairing academic performance. Adolescents who experience insufficient sleep are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues such as depression and anxiety (Roberts et al., 2009). These psychological challenges can hinder learning and academic success, as they affect motivation, concentration, and the ability to cope with academic stress.\n\n### Public Health Recommendations\n\nTo mitigate the negative impact of smartphone usage on sleep and academic performance, public health guidelines recommend limiting screen time, particularly before bedtime. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that adolescents should have no more than two hours of recreational screen time per day and should avoid screens at least one hour before bedtime (AAP, 2016). Implementing these guidelines can help improve sleep quality and, consequently, academic performance.\n\n## Potential Benefits of Restricting Smartphone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools\n\n### Improved Sleep Quality\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools can significantly improve sleep quality among adolescents. By reducing exposure to blue light and minimizing time displacement, students are more likely to fall asleep faster and enjoy better sleep quality. This can lead to longer sleep durations and reduced sleep disturbances, contributing to overall better health and well-being.\n\n### Enhanced Academic Performance\n\nImproved sleep quality is directly linked to enhanced cognitive function, attention, and memory, all of which are critical for academic success. By limiting nighttime smartphone use, boarding schools can help students achieve better-rested states, leading to increased alertness and cognitive performance during the day. This can result in improved academic outcomes and a more positive school experience.\n\n### Mental Health Benefits\n\nLimiting smartphone use at night can also have significant mental health benefits. Adequate sleep is essential for emotional regulation and psychological well-being. By promoting healthy sleep habits, boarding schools can reduce the risk of depressive symptoms and anxiety among students, contributing to a more supportive and nurturing environment.\n\n### Promotion of Healthy Sleep Habits\n\nBoarding schools have a unique opportunity to instill good sleep hygiene practices in students. By enforcing policies that limit technology use at night, schools can promote long-term healthy sleep habits that students can carry into adulthood. This proactive approach can have lasting benefits for students\' health and academic success.\n\n### Reduction in Daytime Sleepiness\n\nWith improved sleep quality, students are likely to experience less daytime sleepiness, leading to increased participation and engagement in school activities. This can enhance the overall school experience and contribute to a more vibrant and dynamic learning environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers\' sleep quality and academic performance underscore the need for interventions that promote healthy technology use and sleep hygiene. Restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools has the potential to significantly improve sleep quality, academic performance, and mental health among adolescents. By addressing the negative impact of nighttime smartphone use, schools can foster an environment conducive to better sleep hygiene, mental health, and academic success. Implementing such measures can be a proactive step towards enhancing the overall well-being of adolescents.\n\n## References\n\n- American Academy of Pediatrics. (2016). Media and Young Minds.

This report examines the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among teenagers. It further explores how restricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools might improve these outcomes. The analysis draws on findings from recent studies and reviews, providing a comprehensive understanding of the issue.\n\n## Background\n\n### Importance of Sleep in Adolescents\n\nSleep is a critical component of adolescent health, essential for physical growth, cognitive development, and emotional regulation. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that teenagers receive 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night. However, the natural delay in circadian rhythms during adolescence often leads to later sleep onset and wake times, making it challenging to achieve adequate sleep duration.\n\n### Smartphone Usage Among Teenagers\n\nSmartphones have become ubiquitous among teenagers, with a significant percentage using these devices extensively throughout the day and night. The convenience and connectivity offered by smartphones can lead to excessive use, often encroaching on time that should be allocated for sleep.\n\n## Impact of Smartphone Usage on Sleep Quality\n\n### Circadian Rhythm Disruption\n\nSmartphones emit blue light, which is known to suppress melatonin secretion, a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles. This suppression can lead to delayed sleep onset and disrupted circadian rhythms, resulting in poor sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency (Cureus, 2023).\n\n### Sleep Displacement\n\nThe unstructured nature of smartphone use, particularly at night, can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use lacks a clear endpoint, which can extend usage time and encroach on sleep duration (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n### Content-Induced Arousal\n\nThe type of content consumed on smartphones, such as stimulating games or videos, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset. This heightened state of arousal can further degrade sleep quality and contribute to daytime sleepiness (Cureus, 2023).\n\n### Short Sleep Duration\n\nStudies have consistently shown that increased smartphone use is associated with shorter sleep duration. This is particularly concerning for adolescents, who require adequate sleep for cognitive and physical development (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n### Bidirectional Relationship\n\nThere is evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship between smartphone use and sleep disturbances. While smartphone use can lead to poor sleep, existing sleep issues may also drive increased smartphone use as a coping mechanism (Cureus, 2023).\n\n## Consequences for Adolescents\n\n### Academic Performance\n\nSleep is critical for memory consolidation and learning. Disrupted sleep patterns due to smartphone use can impair academic performance, as sleep deprivation affects attention, focus, and cognitive processing (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n### Mental Health\n\nChronic sleep deprivation linked to smartphone use can exacerbate mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these effects due to ongoing developmental changes (Cureus, 2023).\n\n### Physical Health\n\nBeyond mental health, poor sleep quality can have broader health implications, including increased risk for metabolic disorders and weakened immune function (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n## Restricting Phone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools\n\n### Potential Benefits\n\n1. **Improved Sleep Quality**: Restricting phone access after bedtime can reduce exposure to blue light and content-induced arousal, leading to better sleep quality and duration.\n\n2. **Enhanced Academic Performance**: With improved sleep, students are likely to experience better cognitive functioning, attention, and memory, positively impacting their academic performance.\n\n3. **Better Mental Health**: Adequate sleep can help mitigate the risk of mental health issues, promoting emotional stability and resilience.\n\n4. **Healthier Habits**: Establishing a routine that limits nighttime smartphone use can encourage healthier sleep hygiene and overall lifestyle habits.\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n\n1. **Policy Development**: Boarding schools can develop policies that restrict smartphone use after a certain time, ensuring students have a technology-free environment conducive to sleep.\n\n2. **Education and Counseling**: Schools can provide education and counseling to students about the importance of sleep and the risks associated with excessive smartphone use.\n\n3. **Parental Involvement**: Engaging parents in the process can reinforce the importance of these policies and encourage similar practices at home.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n| **Factor**                  | **Smartphone Usage** | **Restricted Access** |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Sleep Quality**           | Poor                 | Improved              |\n| **Academic Performance**    | Impaired             | Enhanced              |\n| **Mental Health**           | At Risk              | Stabilized            |\n| **Physical Health**         | Compromised          | Strengthened          |\n| **Lifestyle Habits**        | Unhealthy            | Healthier             |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe pervasive use of smartphones among teenagers has significant implications for sleep quality and academic performance. The evidence suggests that restricting phone access after bedtime, particularly in boarding schools, can lead to improved outcomes in these areas. By implementing targeted interventions and promoting awareness, schools can play a crucial role in safeguarding the health and academic success of adolescents in an increasingly digital world.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Screen Time Guidelines**: Health organizations recommend limiting screen time for adolescents to no more than two hours per day to mitigate the negative effects on sleep and overall health.\n\n2. **Pre-Bedtime Restrictions**: Encouraging adolescents to avoid smartphone use at least 30 minutes before bedtime can improve sleep quality and duration.\n\n3. **Education and Counseling**: Raising awareness about the impact of smartphone use on sleep and providing counseling to adolescents can help promote healthier usage patterns and improve sleep hygiene.\n\n4. **Further Research**: Conduct longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term effects of smartphone use on adolescent sleep and well-being.\n\n## References\n\n- Cureus.

This report delves into the documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers\' sleep and academic outcomes, and explores how restricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools might improve these outcomes. The analysis is based on a systematic literature review titled "The Influence of Smartphones on Adolescent Sleep," which provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between smartphone use, sleep disturbances, and academic performance in adolescents.\n\n## Effects of Smartphone Usage on Teenagers\' Sleep Quality\n\n### Disruption of Circadian Rhythms\n\nSmartphone usage, particularly at night, has been shown to disrupt adolescents\' circadian rhythms. The blue light emitted by smartphone screens is a significant factor in this disruption. It suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles, leading to delayed sleep onset and reduced sleep efficiency (Cajochen et al., 2011). This disruption is particularly concerning during adolescence, a period characterized by natural shifts in circadian rhythms that already predispose teenagers to later sleep times (Crowley et al., 2018).\n\n### Sleep Displacement\n\nSmartphones often serve as a source of unstructured leisure activities, which can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities with clear endpoints, smartphone use can extend indefinitely, resulting in prolonged usage and delayed sleep (Cain & Gradisar, 2010). This displacement of sleep time is exacerbated by the engaging nature of smartphone content, which can include social media, games, and videos.\n\n### Content-Induced Arousal\n\nThe type of content consumed on smartphones can also impact sleep quality. Engaging or stimulating content, such as activating music, arousing images, or interactive video games, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset (Hale & Guan, 2015). This heightened state of arousal can lead to reduced sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness, further affecting adolescents\' daily functioning.\n\n### Sleep Quality and Duration\n\nNumerous studies have documented the negative impact of smartphone usage on sleep quality and duration. A systematic review by Carter et al. (2016) found that 90% of studies reported a significant association between screen media use and delayed bedtime or decreased total sleep time. Adolescents who use smartphones at night often experience shorter sleep durations, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness, all of which can have detrimental effects on their overall well-being.\n\n## Impact on Academic Performance\n\n### Cognitive and Academic Impairment\n\nSleep plays a crucial role in cognitive processes such as memory consolidation and learning. Sleep deprivation due to smartphone use can impair these cognitive functions, leading to subpar academic performance (Curcio et al., 2006). Studies have consistently demonstrated a relationship between poor sleep quality and decreased academic outcomes, with sleep-deprived students showing reduced attention, memory, and problem-solving abilities (Dewald et al., 2010).\n\n### Mental Health and Learning\n\nChronic sleep deprivation from excessive smartphone use can also impact mental health, further impairing academic performance. Adolescents who experience insufficient sleep are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues such as depression and anxiety (Roberts et al., 2009). These psychological challenges can hinder learning and academic success, as they affect motivation, concentration, and the ability to cope with academic stress.\n\n### Public Health Recommendations\n\nTo mitigate the negative impact of smartphone usage on sleep and academic performance, public health guidelines recommend limiting screen time, particularly before bedtime. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that adolescents should have no more than two hours of recreational screen time per day and should avoid screens at least one hour before bedtime (AAP, 2016). Implementing these guidelines can help improve sleep quality and, consequently, academic performance.\n\n## Potential Benefits of Restricting Smartphone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools\n\n### Improved Sleep Quality\n\nRestricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools can significantly improve sleep quality among adolescents. By reducing exposure to blue light and minimizing time displacement, students are more likely to fall asleep faster and enjoy better sleep quality. This can lead to longer sleep durations and reduced sleep disturbances, contributing to overall better health and well-being.\n\n### Enhanced Academic Performance\n\nImproved sleep quality is directly linked to enhanced cognitive function, attention, and memory, all of which are critical for academic success. By limiting nighttime smartphone use, boarding schools can help students achieve better-rested states, leading to increased alertness and cognitive performance during the day. This can result in improved academic outcomes and a more positive school experience.\n\n### Mental Health Benefits\n\nLimiting smartphone use at night can also have significant mental health benefits. Adequate sleep is essential for emotional regulation and psychological well-being. By promoting healthy sleep habits, boarding schools can reduce the risk of depressive symptoms and anxiety among students, contributing to a more supportive and nurturing environment.\n\n### Promotion of Healthy Sleep Habits\n\nBoarding schools have a unique opportunity to instill good sleep hygiene practices in students. By enforcing policies that limit technology use at night, schools can promote long-term healthy sleep habits that students can carry into adulthood. This proactive approach can have lasting benefits for students\' health and academic success.\n\n### Reduction in Daytime Sleepiness\n\nWith improved sleep quality, students are likely to experience less daytime sleepiness, leading to increased participation and engagement in school activities. This can enhance the overall school experience and contribute to a more vibrant and dynamic learning environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers\' sleep quality and academic performance underscore the need for interventions that promote healthy technology use and sleep hygiene. Restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools has the potential to significantly improve sleep quality, academic performance, and mental health among adolescents. By addressing the negative impact of nighttime smartphone use, schools can foster an environment conducive to better sleep hygiene, mental health, and academic success. Implementing such measures can be a proactive step towards enhancing the overall well-being of adolescents.\n\n## References\n\n- American Academy of Pediatrics. (2016). Media and Young Minds.

This report examines the documented effects of smartphone usage on sleep quality and academic performance among teenagers. It further explores how restricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools might improve these outcomes. The analysis draws on findings from recent studies and reviews, providing a comprehensive understanding of the issue.\n\n## Background\n\n### Importance of Sleep in Adolescents\n\nSleep is a critical component of adolescent health, essential for physical growth, cognitive development, and emotional regulation. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that teenagers receive 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night. However, the natural delay in circadian rhythms during adolescence often leads to later sleep onset and wake times, making it challenging to achieve adequate sleep duration.\n\n### Smartphone Usage Among Teenagers\n\nSmartphones have become ubiquitous among teenagers, with a significant percentage using these devices extensively throughout the day and night. The convenience and connectivity offered by smartphones can lead to excessive use, often encroaching on time that should be allocated for sleep.\n\n## Impact of Smartphone Usage on Sleep Quality\n\n### Circadian Rhythm Disruption\n\nSmartphones emit blue light, which is known to suppress melatonin secretion, a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles. This suppression can lead to delayed sleep onset and disrupted circadian rhythms, resulting in poor sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency (Cureus, 2023).\n\n### Sleep Displacement\n\nThe unstructured nature of smartphone use, particularly at night, can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use lacks a clear endpoint, which can extend usage time and encroach on sleep duration (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n### Content-Induced Arousal\n\nThe type of content consumed on smartphones, such as stimulating games or videos, can increase alertness and delay sleep onset. This heightened state of arousal can further degrade sleep quality and contribute to daytime sleepiness (Cureus, 2023).\n\n### Short Sleep Duration\n\nStudies have consistently shown that increased smartphone use is associated with shorter sleep duration. This is particularly concerning for adolescents, who require adequate sleep for cognitive and physical development (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n### Bidirectional Relationship\n\nThere is evidence suggesting a bidirectional relationship between smartphone use and sleep disturbances. While smartphone use can lead to poor sleep, existing sleep issues may also drive increased smartphone use as a coping mechanism (Cureus, 2023).\n\n## Consequences for Adolescents\n\n### Academic Performance\n\nSleep is critical for memory consolidation and learning. Disrupted sleep patterns due to smartphone use can impair academic performance, as sleep deprivation affects attention, focus, and cognitive processing (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n### Mental Health\n\nChronic sleep deprivation linked to smartphone use can exacerbate mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these effects due to ongoing developmental changes (Cureus, 2023).\n\n### Physical Health\n\nBeyond mental health, poor sleep quality can have broader health implications, including increased risk for metabolic disorders and weakened immune function (de Sá et al., 2023).\n\n## Restricting Phone Access After Bedtime in Boarding Schools\n\n### Potential Benefits\n\n1. **Improved Sleep Quality**: Restricting phone access after bedtime can reduce exposure to blue light and content-induced arousal, leading to better sleep quality and duration.\n\n2. **Enhanced Academic Performance**: With improved sleep, students are likely to experience better cognitive functioning, attention, and memory, positively impacting their academic performance.\n\n3. **Better Mental Health**: Adequate sleep can help mitigate the risk of mental health issues, promoting emotional stability and resilience.\n\n4. **Healthier Habits**: Establishing a routine that limits nighttime smartphone use can encourage healthier sleep hygiene and overall lifestyle habits.\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n\n1. **Policy Development**: Boarding schools can develop policies that restrict smartphone use after a certain time, ensuring students have a technology-free environment conducive to sleep.\n\n2. **Education and Counseling**: Schools can provide education and counseling to students about the importance of sleep and the risks associated with excessive smartphone use.\n\n3. **Parental Involvement**: Engaging parents in the process can reinforce the importance of these policies and encourage similar practices at home.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n| **Factor**                  | **Smartphone Usage** | **Restricted Access** |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Sleep Quality**           | Poor                 | Improved              |\n| **Academic Performance**    | Impaired             | Enhanced              |\n| **Mental Health**           | At Risk              | Stabilized            |\n| **Physical Health**         | Compromised          | Strengthened          |\n| **Lifestyle Habits**        | Unhealthy            | Healthier             |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe pervasive use of smartphones among teenagers has significant implications for sleep quality and academic performance.

This position is grounded in the substantial evidence linking smartphone usage to poor sleep quality and diminished academic performance among students.\n\nFirstly, the correlation between smartphone addiction and poor sleep quality is well-documented. The study conducted in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, highlights a positive correlation (r = 0.261; p < 0.001) between high levels of smartphone addiction and poor sleep quality [Source: Research Report]. This is significant because sleep is crucial for cognitive functioning, which directly impacts academic success. Poor sleep quality can lead to cognitive impairments, affecting memory, attention, and problem-solving skills, all of which are essential for students' academic performance.\n\nFurthermore, students with restricted phone access after bedtime generally report better sleep quality. Limiting exposure to screens before sleep can reduce sleep latency and improve overall sleep duration and quality [Source: Research Report]. This improved sleep quality is associated with enhanced academic performance, as these students tend to have higher grades and better cognitive functioning.\n\nBoarding schools have the unique opportunity to implement structured routines and policies that promote healthy smartphone usage. By restricting phone access after bedtime, schools can create an environment conducive to better sleep hygiene, thereby supporting students' academic success. This approach not only addresses the immediate issue of sleep disturbances but also fosters long-term academic and personal development.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence strongly supports the implementation of policies to restrict smartphone usage after bedtime in boarding schools. This measure is a proactive step towards ensuring that students receive the quality sleep necessary for optimal academic performance and overall well-being.\n\nMom: As a parent, my perspective on the issue of restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools is rooted in a balanced approach that considers both the benefits and potential drawbacks of such a policy. While I understand the concerns about smartphone usage affecting sleep quality and academic performance, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge the documented effects of smartphone usage on teenagers' sleep quality. Research indicates that smartphone use, particularly at night, can disrupt circadian rhythms and delay sleep onset due to blue light exposure [Source: Cajochen et al., 2011]. This disruption can lead to reduced sleep efficiency and shorter sleep durations, which are concerning given the critical role of sleep in cognitive functioning and academic success [Source: Curcio et al., 2006].\n\nHowever, smartphones also serve as essential tools for communication and learning. In a boarding school setting, where students are away from home, smartphones can provide a vital link to family and friends, offering emotional support and reducing feelings of isolation. This aspect of smartphone usage should not be overlooked, as emotional well-being is closely tied to academic performance and overall health.\n\nMoreover, while restricting phone access after bedtime might improve sleep quality, it is crucial to consider the potential impact on students' autonomy and ability to self-regulate. Teaching students to manage their screen time responsibly can foster important life skills, such as time management and self-discipline, which are valuable beyond the school environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is evidence supporting the restriction of smartphone usage after bedtime to improve sleep quality and academic performance, it is essential to balance these benefits with the need for emotional support and the development of self-regulation skills. A comprehensive approach that includes education on healthy smartphone habits and encourages responsible usage may be more effective in promoting students' overall well-being and academic success.\n\nJohn: As a student, my perspective on the issue of restricting smartphone access after bedtime in boarding schools is primarily focused on the potential benefits for sleep quality and academic performance, which are crucial for our overall well-being and success.\n\nFirstly, the impact of smartphone usage on sleep quality is well-documented. Smartphones emit blue light, which can suppress melatonin secretion, a hormone essential for regulating sleep-wake cycles. This suppression can lead to delayed sleep onset and disrupted circadian rhythms, resulting in poor sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency [Source: Cureus, 2023]. Given that sleep is critical for cognitive functioning, memory consolidation, and learning, the negative effects of smartphone use on sleep can directly impair academic performance [Source: de Sá et al., 2023].\n\nMoreover, the unstructured nature of smartphone use, especially at night, can lead to sleep displacement. Unlike structured activities, smartphone use lacks a clear endpoint, which can extend usage time and encroach on sleep duration [Source: de Sá et al., 2023]. This is particularly concerning for adolescents, who require 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night for optimal physical and cognitive development [Source: National Sleep Foundation].\n\nRestricting phone access after bedtime in boarding schools could significantly improve sleep quality by reducing exposure to blue light and content-induced arousal, leading to better sleep duration and efficiency. This, in turn, can enhance academic performance by improving attention, focus, and cognitive processing [Source: de Sá et al., 2023].\n\nAdditionally, adequate sleep can help mitigate the risk of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, promoting emotional stability and resilience [Source: Cureus, 2023]. Establishing a routine that limits nighttime smartphone use can encourage healthier sleep hygiene and overall lifestyle habits, contributing to better physical health and well-being [Source: de Sá et al., 2023].\n\nIn conclusion, while smartphones are valuable tools for communication and learning, the potential benefits of restricting their use after bedtime in boarding schools, particularly in terms of sleep quality and academic performance, are significant.
